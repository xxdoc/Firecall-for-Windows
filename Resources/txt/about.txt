FIRE CALL for WINDOWS

Fire Call Win is a simple chat tool that allows two users, typically developers, to communicate person-to-person using encrypted transfer via  shared files and folders. Files can be transferred and exchanged, chat and data swapped on almost real-time basis. This version uses the basic Dropbox service to share files and folders but it can also use any shared file or folder resource over a network of some sort as long as it appears as a locally accessible resource to Windows. In addition to chat, Emojis, voice recordings and user files can be shared too.in a dieselpunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized and placed anywhere on your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give your desktop a dieselpunk make-over. 

Right-click on the widget to display the function menu, it works well on Windows XP to Windows 11.This version was developed on Windows 7 using 32 bit VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS project creating a WoW64 program for the desktop. 

It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement and community contribution towards free-and-useful VB6 utilities that can be created by anyone. The first step was the creation of this 32bit WoW64 program.  A future step is a conversion of to RADBasic/TwinBasic for future-proofing and essential 64bit-ness. 

This program is free and FOSS. The basic file and folder sharing services are free, this program uses Dropbox out of the box but Google Drive and Microsoft's Onedrive all provide basic file and folder sharing facilities for free.

This utility is one of a set of steampunk and dieselpunk programs written in VB6 and javascript -that you can find here on Deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery

I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you choose to contribute.
