2021-06-10 17:13:02.310 Deanie chap:    sorry 5
2021-06-10 17:12:41.500 Deanie chap:    test 4
2021-06-10 17:11:00.110 Deanie chap:    test 4

2021-06-10 17:07:29.350 Deanie chap:    test 2
2021-06-10 17:06:09.710 Deanie chap:    testing again
2021-06-10 17:00:17.880 Deanie chap:    I can see the same text in the .js version so I am assuming all is well.
2021-06-10 16:59:39.980 Deanie chap:    but from this side of t'net it seems like it is doing it correctly
2021-06-10 16:58:18.390 Deanie chap:    format
2021-06-10 16:58:15.060 Deanie chap:    the only thing that worries me is the file and line formet
2021-06-10 16:57:52.950 Deanie chap:    It all seems to be going well so far, the timestamp seems good
2021-06-10 16:57:17.180 Deanie chap:    Sending from the new Fire Call Win
2021-06-10 16:56:47.980 Deanie chap:    texting, texting, 1-2-3!
2021-06-10 15:54:46.431 Deanie chap:    I will tell you when I am writing it, just before
2021-06-10 15:54:27.083 Deanie chap:    can you see if it works for you
2021-06-10 15:54:20.082 Deanie chap:    so expect some strangeness
2021-06-10 15:54:14.231 Deanie chap:    I am working on the live output file (I have taken a copy)
2021-06-10 15:35:33.221 Deanie chap:    I now need to build the timestamp
2021-06-10 15:35:30.477 Deanie chap:    I worked on an intermediate temporary file
2021-06-10 15:35:00.721 Deanie chap:    r
2021-06-10 15:34:58.338 Deanie chap:    witing the output file is working
2021-06-10 11:43:54.360 Deanie chap:    I am testing the writing of the output file  so you might see some junk on occasion
2021-06-10 11:10:32.078 Deanie chap:    a chiropodist came here to the house
2021-06-10 11:10:13.849 Deanie chap:    mum just had the same
2021-06-10 10:12:32.676 Deanie chap:    all done
2021-06-10 10:12:18.839 Deanie chap:    so I have to add the right click trap code to all major controls too
2021-06-10 10:12:01.460 Deanie chap:    as any control interrupts the click through oto the form
2021-06-10 10:11:45.017 Deanie chap:    the right click for the menu has to be captured on a whole form and component level
2021-06-10 10:02:44.211 Deanie chap:    all the menu options to open the input/output files and exchange folder all function as they should
2021-06-10 01:01:10.901 Deanie chap:    I added a timer in code
2021-06-10 01:01:02.619 Deanie chap:    going to bed
2021-06-10 01:00:56.377 Deanie chap:    up late
2021-06-10 01:00:54.307 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 22:31:48.642 Deanie chap:    I may implement a timer in code instead
2021-06-09 22:31:35.261 Deanie chap:    the timer is reading the timer values but the VB6 timer is maximum of 65000 millisecs
2021-06-09 22:25:12.749 Deanie chap:    as expected
2021-06-09 22:25:07.755 Deanie chap:    the loading at top/bottom functions
2021-06-09 21:18:21.270 Deanie chap:    on a bed of noodles
2021-06-09 21:18:15.557 Deanie chap:    and brocolli stems broiled with garlic
2021-06-09 21:17:48.907 Deanie chap:    pork steaks in a mustard/honey marinade
2021-06-09 21:17:27.480 Deanie chap:    barbequed in the garden
2021-06-09 21:17:18.791 Deanie chap:    just warmth
2021-06-09 21:17:13.981 Deanie chap:    no rain here
2021-06-09 21:17:11.161 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 21:16:28.880 Deanie chap:    after that drag and drop
2021-06-09 21:16:23.463 Deanie chap:    and then implement the attachments
2021-06-09 21:16:06.849 Deanie chap:    next I will add text input
2021-06-09 21:15:46.447 Deanie chap:    It certianly simplifies the code!
2021-06-09 21:15:27.209 Deanie chap:    but I may make it optional
2021-06-09 21:15:17.463 Deanie chap:    It is meant as an interim
2021-06-09 21:15:03.186 Deanie chap:    all in one place
2021-06-09 21:14:54.317 Deanie chap:    as it means I can review your messages
2021-06-09 21:14:35.534 Deanie chap:    The twin boxes for input/output is quite nice
2021-06-09 18:49:17.180 Deanie chap:    <><>FCWTwoBoxes.png
2021-06-09 18:32:54.412 Deanie chap:    <o><o>1F60C RELIEVED FACE.png
2021-06-09 18:31:23.243 Deanie chap:    it has both now
2021-06-09 18:31:14.391 Deanie chap:    they need to be added by a win API tweak
2021-06-09 18:30:59.076 Deanie chap:    but no horizontal ones
2021-06-09 18:30:47.583 Deanie chap:    sorry, it has vert scrollbars built in
2021-06-09 18:30:23.820 Deanie chap:    they list box has horizontal scrollbars built in
2021-06-09 18:30:04.181 Deanie chap:    I am using a line in a list box to contain each line of the array
2021-06-09 18:29:31.823 Deanie chap:    it retains the array between timer runs and only changes the single item in the listbox that requires an update
2021-06-09 18:28:55.170 Deanie chap:    it checks the file/date modification time before it makes any changes
2021-06-09 18:28:19.381 Deanie chap:    the FCW FireCallWin prog is doing its job
2021-06-09 18:23:11.118 Deanie chap:    appalling the way they were treated
2021-06-09 18:22:52.846 Deanie chap:    I remember at the time feeling so sorry for poor ordinary chaps at the whim of an unforgiving bureaucracy and a quasi-governmental computer system with all the authority of law behind it
2021-06-09 14:44:36.813 Deanie chap:    but .js to VB would be wrong method
2021-06-09 14:44:18.330 Deanie chap:    and vb6 to vbscript probably too
2021-06-09 14:44:01.946 Deanie chap:    with javscript to jscript is is do-able
2021-06-09 14:43:46.771 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 14:43:45.031 Deanie chap:    as I realise that migrating routine by routine is fraught with problems unless the two languages are just variants of each other
2021-06-09 14:43:09.100 Deanie chap:    I'm not migrating the code just the functionality
2021-06-09 14:42:44.559 Deanie chap:    and I will take hints from the .JS for more interesting functions
2021-06-09 14:42:21.985 Deanie chap:    I am doing the standard stuff 'the VB6 way'
2021-06-09 14:41:57.439 Deanie chap:    I have the .JS code open
2021-06-09 14:41:45.781 Deanie chap:    but not apprciably so in the context of a text file with a few hundred lines
2021-06-09 14:41:26.638 Deanie chap:    it is slower than native vb6 iput
2021-06-09 14:41:16.067 Deanie chap:    using the filesystemobject
2021-06-09 14:41:05.875 Deanie chap:    so I can still call a different method of reading a file
2021-06-09 14:40:48.889 Deanie chap:    later version use tools that handle all EOL
2021-06-09 14:40:34.148 Deanie chap:    windows doesn't like them in older versions
2021-06-09 14:40:19.033 Deanie chap:    vb6 doesn't like them
2021-06-09 14:38:30.653 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 14:38:24.963 Deanie chap:    then I can read that top to bottom or bottom to top and display it that way
2021-06-09 14:38:06.926 Deanie chap:    I am reading all the lines into an array
2021-06-09 14:37:55.462 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 14:37:54.002 Deanie chap:    until I mix the two streams
2021-06-09 14:37:42.867 Deanie chap:    the output will gor into a separate window temporarily
2021-06-09 14:37:25.951 Deanie chap:    At the moment I am just handling the input
2021-06-09 14:37:16.969 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 14:37:16.477 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 14:37:08.805 Deanie chap:    so I can see your messages in approx. real time
2021-06-09 14:36:55.422 Deanie chap:    the tool is on a loop at 10 secs at the moment
2021-06-09 14:36:31.225 Deanie chap:    properly using the windows default method expecting vbCRLF
2021-06-09 14:36:07.367 Deanie chap:    as it was not reading the CR LF
2021-06-09 14:35:50.338 Deanie chap:    I have changed the EOL method
2021-06-09 14:35:39.404 Deanie chap:    your messages are coming through loud and clear into fireCallWin
2021-06-09 14:35:22.751 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 14:35:20.861 Deanie chap:    and interesting
2021-06-09 14:35:17.250 Deanie chap:    understood
2021-06-09 13:37:02.525 Deanie chap:    texting the on-screen updating of the input file
2021-06-09 13:36:42.349 Deanie chap:    can you send me a message every now and then?
2021-06-09 13:36:32.277 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 13:26:04.759 Deanie chap:    what are you using the ellipse generator for?
2021-06-09 13:25:54.475 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 13:25:54.055 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 13:25:27.970 Deanie chap:    testing
2021-06-09 13:25:16.666 Deanie chap:    the round button is gone during tresting
2021-06-09 13:25:02.139 Deanie chap:    <><>Untitled-2.png
2021-06-09 12:12:05.471 Deanie chap:    working so far
2021-06-09 12:11:58.120 Deanie chap:    I am reading the input file and displaying the input text in a listbox with scrollbars
2021-06-09 12:11:39.994 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 11:01:57.309 Deanie chap:    but I have a template
2021-06-09 11:01:39.779 Deanie chap:    although I am not there yet
2021-06-09 11:01:15.342 Deanie chap:    that is what inspired me to create the same in VB
2021-06-09 11:01:02.986 Deanie chap:    I remember your pref generating tool
2021-06-09 11:00:54.358 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 11:00:47.908 Deanie chap:    and then I can at least recreate the prefs
2021-06-09 11:00:36.284 Deanie chap:    I just want to be able to read XML files from my widgets
2021-06-09 11:00:20.952 Deanie chap:    I understand the reasoning
2021-06-09 10:35:14.049 Deanie chap:    being able to do what it could do
2021-06-09 10:34:53.049 Deanie chap:    The more I create the functionality of the the old YWE I realise how advanced it was
2021-06-09 10:34:32.190 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 10:34:19.358 Deanie chap:    step by step as usual
2021-06-09 10:34:13.766 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-09 10:34:07.981 Deanie chap:    then I will add the readingm writing and display of the input/output files
2021-06-09 10:33:33.637 Deanie chap:    I am jus completing the validation of data
2021-06-09 10:33:19.365 Deanie chap:    it reads things like the emoji list and opens the config file, allows attachments
2021-06-09 10:32:39.759 Deanie chap:    I created it first then decided to quickly create the firecall UI
2021-06-09 10:32:18.861 Deanie chap:    but for the moment I have a prefs that does what I need
2021-06-09 10:31:57.226 Deanie chap:    I am part way on that path
2021-06-09 10:31:43.197 Deanie chap:    whilst doing it I was thinking about how to read a prefs XML file and automatically creating a prefs based upon that
2021-06-09 10:30:58.293 Deanie chap:    all the data is read/validated and written as it should be
2021-06-09 10:30:17.502 Deanie chap:    adding a few extra controls as I will use it as a template in future
2021-06-09 10:30:00.504 Deanie chap:    the prefs was a functional duplicate just for the sake of it
2021-06-09 09:54:30.699 Deanie chap:    lovely day again
2021-06-09 00:14:51.523 Deanie chap:    night night
2021-06-09 00:14:48.724 Deanie chap:    all
2021-06-09 00:14:46.851 Deanie chap:    and I'll see whether I need them
2021-06-09 00:14:38.243 Deanie chap:    just duplicated
2021-06-09 00:14:33.660 Deanie chap:    those are the VB6 prefs
2021-06-09 00:14:16.758 Deanie chap:    Its the Vb6 app
2021-06-08 21:04:59.891 Deanie chap:    What do you think?
2021-06-08 17:07:13.007 Deanie chap:    <><>firecallwin01.png
2021-06-08 11:58:13.220 Deanie chap:    lovely here too
2021-06-07 00:32:35.955 Deanie chap:    off to bed now
2021-06-07 00:32:30.215 Deanie chap:    that is why I am up late
2021-06-07 00:32:23.903 Deanie chap:    I have just spent some time debugging a tricky issue
2021-06-07 00:32:07.739 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-07 00:32:03.737 Deanie chap:    things will resolve themselves when I merge the three utilities
2021-06-07 00:31:41.514 Deanie chap:    what that does is re-open the file and pass that to iconsettings
2021-06-07 00:31:25.467 Deanie chap:    and click on icon properties
2021-06-07 00:31:19.245 Deanie chap:    best then to  right click on that same icon
2021-06-07 00:31:05.704 Deanie chap:    if you drag and drop to the dock, then the settings file has been updated
2021-06-07 00:30:47.757 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-07 00:30:46.724 Deanie chap:    For the moment though, you just need to realise which is the current owner and work that way
2021-06-07 00:30:06.670 Deanie chap:    and then the file access will be sorted out
2021-06-07 00:29:54.031 Deanie chap:    instead, I plan to merge the three utilities into one program for steamydock operation
2021-06-07 00:29:29.206 Deanie chap:    I don't think I will
2021-06-07 00:29:17.832 Deanie chap:    so I have played with the idea of adding some token control but
2021-06-07 00:28:52.928 Deanie chap:    and there is no token or control to say who is editing what
2021-06-07 00:28:34.915 Deanie chap:    Well, at the moment the two programs are separate but they work from the same flat file
2021-06-06 19:34:59.733 Deanie chap:    just right
2021-06-06 19:34:54.130 Deanie chap:    19 inside
2021-06-06 19:34:48.761 Deanie chap:    18 here outside
2021-06-06 18:37:23.537 Deanie chap:    next day it becomes Chilli
2021-06-06 18:37:13.422 Deanie chap:    when making bolognese I always add lentils
2021-06-06 18:37:03.183 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-06 18:37:02.382 Deanie chap:    which I turn into something else the next day
2021-06-06 18:36:49.653 Deanie chap:    very good in a cottage pie and it pads it out so much that there are always leftovers
2021-06-06 18:36:27.219 Deanie chap:    and thus stay in shape
2021-06-06 18:36:20.192 Deanie chap:    as they do not have to cook for a long time
2021-06-06 18:36:10.560 Deanie chap:    lentils in tins are very good
2021-06-06 18:35:58.716 Deanie chap:    I put a lot of lentils in my cottage pie and they act like a psuedo-mince
2021-06-06 18:35:21.303 Deanie chap:    You can mix the two but it rather defeats the purpose
2021-06-06 16:16:01.656 Deanie chap:    different enough
2021-06-06 16:15:39.476 Deanie chap:    Frabulator
2021-06-06 16:15:33.609 Deanie chap:    Just thought of a name for a replacement widget engine

2021-06-06 16:04:13.869 Deanie chap:    so lower expectations!
2021-06-06 16:03:54.818 Deanie chap:    it is nothing special
2021-06-06 16:03:48.953 Deanie chap:    to show you my present to you
2021-06-06 16:03:40.898 Deanie chap:    I will send you an image or two in a shortish while
2021-06-06 16:03:28.558 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-06 16:03:23.096 Deanie chap:    for real usable systems
2021-06-06 16:03:17.822 Deanie chap:    when I am packaging
2021-06-06 16:03:09.150 Deanie chap:    I see it is a end-game task
2021-06-06 16:03:01.851 Deanie chap:    I will research the admin issues when I have made more progress
2021-06-06 16:02:47.728 Deanie chap:    OK
2021-06-06 16:02:40.166 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-06 15:35:00.778 Deanie chap:    ensuring admin
2021-06-06 15:34:54.880 Deanie chap:    or run iconsettings from a separate icon on the desktop
2021-06-06 15:34:38.663 Deanie chap:    for the moment though I recommend setting UAC to none or minimum
2021-06-06 15:34:19.634 Deanie chap:    I have a win10 laptop and I'll update it and try it out with typical settings
2021-06-06 15:33:58.960 Deanie chap:    To test it on Win10, I'll have to start using Win10 for a bit
2021-06-06 15:29:39.981 Deanie chap:    have it done soon
2021-06-06 15:29:33.658 Deanie chap:    I am working on my present for you
2021-06-06 15:29:20.862 Deanie chap:    life and VB6 is a massive learning process
2021-06-06 14:57:20.021 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-06 14:57:16.571 Deanie chap:    it is a godsend
2021-06-06 14:57:09.950 Deanie chap:    due to mum taking so much time for care &c
2021-06-06 14:56:45.062 Deanie chap:    our first Tesco delivery
2021-06-06 14:56:38.649 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-06 13:21:02.835 Deanie chap:    at the moment I have to figure out what in Windows is causing it
2021-06-06 13:20:47.032 Deanie chap:    I'll try to detect if that state exists then get it to do something
2021-06-06 13:08:44.675 Deanie chap:    and kill steamydock.exe
2021-06-06 13:08:39.194 Deanie chap:    then run task manager
2021-06-06 13:08:34.143 Deanie chap:    just ctrl alt del
2021-06-06 13:08:28.589 Deanie chap:    no need to reboot
2021-06-06 13:08:24.222 Deanie chap:    if the dock white screens
2021-06-06 13:08:16.056 Deanie chap:    and often run from that
2021-06-06 13:08:06.262 Deanie chap:    I keep an icon on the desktop for the two utlities
2021-06-06 13:07:03.327 Deanie chap:    I am also running win7
2021-06-06 13:06:54.425 Deanie chap:    I do not see the problems
2021-06-06 13:06:47.511 Deanie chap:    as I run with UAC disabled
2021-06-06 13:06:40.708 Deanie chap:    that will tell Win10 what privs it requires
2021-06-06 13:06:27.790 Deanie chap:    until I package and create a manifest
2021-06-06 13:06:19.433 Deanie chap:    For the mo' the admin issues on Win10 might be a pain
2021-06-06 13:05:57.575 Deanie chap:    revisited it a bit yesterday
2021-06-06 13:05:47.357 Deanie chap:    and the effect was not what I was expecting
2021-06-06 13:05:39.404 Deanie chap:    I was making some changes
2021-06-06 13:05:33.298 Deanie chap:    At the moment it is bugged
2021-06-06 12:56:42.182 Deanie chap:    they are on the list
2021-06-06 12:56:33.241 Deanie chap:    and the resulting fonts
2021-06-06 12:56:28.970 Deanie chap:    the tool to select
2021-06-06 12:56:24.327 Deanie chap:    lots to fix re: fonts
2021-06-06 12:56:05.467 Deanie chap:    they both need to be admin
2021-06-06 12:55:58.442 Deanie chap:    when SD calls iconSettings
2021-06-06 12:55:48.005 Deanie chap:    I think your config is not correct
2021-06-06 12:55:31.895 Deanie chap:    tell me wht you were doing
2021-06-06 12:55:26.648 Deanie chap:    the white screen
2021-06-06 12:55:20.772 Deanie chap:    I am working on the font at the mo
2021-06-06 12:44:04.609 Deanie chap:    or rubbish before you know it
2021-06-06 12:43:52.893 Deanie chap:    either ultra reliable
2021-06-06 12:43:47.021 Deanie chap:    Modern devices...
2021-06-06 12:43:36.094 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-06 12:43:20.469 Deanie chap:    SD - good to hear it
2021-06-05 17:47:21.456 Deanie chap:    it has never seen RD
2021-06-05 17:47:10.358 Deanie chap:    My system upstairs runs without RD
2021-06-05 17:46:53.367 Deanie chap:    so copy the icons folders perhaps beforehand
2021-06-05 17:46:41.098 Deanie chap:    with certainty
2021-06-05 17:46:35.523 Deanie chap:    but I cannot remember
2021-06-05 17:46:29.344 Deanie chap:    I think the RD uninstall gives you the option to remove the program but not the data and the icons
2021-06-05 17:46:05.169 Deanie chap:    SD will have logged the icons at their old location and if you remove them trouble will follow
2021-06-05 17:45:37.175 Deanie chap:    but don't remove all the icons if you use them
2021-06-05 17:45:25.756 Deanie chap:    Well yes
2021-06-05 15:17:45.231 Deanie chap:    When yu drag an icon from one part of the dock to another, how long is your delay?
2021-06-05 15:17:25.742 Deanie chap:    Q. for you
2021-06-05 15:17:22.082 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-05 15:16:48.555 Deanie chap:    with the old white GDI+ background we have come to hate through  the use of YWE
2021-06-05 15:16:23.703 Deanie chap:    after a wait of 20 secs or so it returned to the desktop
2021-06-05 15:16:06.791 Deanie chap:    and it white screened
2021-06-05 15:16:00.155 Deanie chap:    I ran one of my older VB6 progs from the dock
2021-06-05 15:15:34.381 Deanie chap:    updates to programs can be a problem if Avast thinks they are new to it
2021-06-05 15:15:01.927 Deanie chap:    and always run any program from the desktop first
2021-06-05 15:14:43.385 Deanie chap:    set up an exclusion for Steamydock
2021-06-05 15:14:28.988 Deanie chap:    please ensure your exclusions are set up within Avast
2021-06-05 15:14:10.252 Deanie chap:    On occasion it has upset SD
2021-06-05 15:13:49.555 Deanie chap:    and the whole process creation is held up whilst it does its job
2021-06-05 15:13:26.061 Deanie chap:    Avast has this problem that when you run a uility for the first time it will run it in a sandbox
2021-06-05 15:12:59.017 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-05 15:12:47.842 Deanie chap:    when you had the system freeze was it a white screen?
2021-06-05 15:12:32.080 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-05 15:12:30.930 Deanie chap:    silly
2021-06-05 13:27:41.888 Deanie chap:    not today but soon enough
2021-06-05 13:27:31.731 Deanie chap:    I have a bit of present for you later
2021-06-05 13:27:24.811 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-05 13:27:24.043 Deanie chap:    all well
2021-06-05 13:27:20.904 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-04 22:07:33.377 Deanie chap:    yes
2021-06-04 17:12:26.048 Deanie chap:    bloody annoying
2021-06-04 13:38:58.447 Deanie chap:    are you planning to create your own similar geographical mapping tool?
2021-06-04 13:38:26.139 Deanie chap:    and engaging
2021-06-04 13:38:20.836 Deanie chap:    I have worked hard to make the iconsettings tool as interesting as possible
2021-06-04 13:37:50.018 Deanie chap:    I know that the interface is everything to a user
2021-06-04 13:37:28.558 Deanie chap:    buttons and fields in weird places
2021-06-04 13:37:19.870 Deanie chap:    differnet sizes
2021-06-04 13:37:14.313 Deanie chap:    lots of inappropriate fonts
2021-06-04 13:36:57.047 Deanie chap:    user interfaces aren't things many do well
2021-06-04 11:55:23.229 Deanie chap:    we have too much to do
2021-06-04 11:55:12.003 Deanie chap:    but I have insisted
2021-06-04 11:55:07.189 Deanie chap:    Lucy loved to shop
2021-06-04 11:54:59.695 Deanie chap:    we are now ordering via Tesco too
2021-06-03 23:05:23.430 Deanie chap:    night night!
2021-06-03 18:34:14.669 Deanie chap:    it is just extracting information from the start menu and registry
2021-06-03 18:33:53.990 Deanie chap:    the utility does little at the moment
2021-06-03 18:33:44.013 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-03 18:33:41.944 Deanie chap:    OK, that's good
2021-06-03 17:16:09.057 Deanie chap:    of DNA
2021-06-03 17:16:01.332 Deanie chap:    watching the video
2021-06-03 17:15:18.329 Deanie chap:    shown above
2021-06-03 17:15:14.245 Deanie chap:    see if pressing the radio buttons bottom left changes the list
2021-06-03 17:14:46.070 Deanie chap:    press that and look at the resulting utility
2021-06-03 17:14:20.038 Deanie chap:    icon settings- generate dock
2021-06-03 17:14:12.234 Deanie chap:    Can you please do me a favour?
2021-06-03 17:14:02.864 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-03 17:14:01.582 Deanie chap:    remind me which a/v tools you now run?
2021-06-03 17:13:49.504 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-03 17:13:34.372 Deanie chap:    What hapened when the system appeared to freeze?
2021-06-03 12:46:08.378 Deanie chap:    will send that through to you later
2021-06-03 12:46:00.262 Deanie chap:    Completed an amendment of the documentation
2021-06-03 10:45:01.914 Deanie chap:    I will test it on Win10 though
2021-06-03 10:44:41.937 Deanie chap:    not my dock
2021-06-03 10:44:37.380 Deanie chap:    that is Windows
2021-06-03 10:44:33.073 Deanie chap:    What the hell!
2021-06-03 09:28:49.001 Deanie chap:     Thu Jun 03 2021 08:50:00 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time)
2021-06-03 09:28:49.002 Deanie chap:     EGSH NORWICH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM

2021-06-03 09:28:49.006 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-03 09:28:49.007 Deanie chap:     Windspeed is 6 knots, force 2, direction WSW
2021-06-03 09:28:42.847 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-03 09:28:39.632 Deanie chap:    bright and clear
2021-06-03 09:28:36.651 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-03 09:28:28.098 Deanie chap:    light rain last night, unexpected
2021-06-03 09:28:20.106 Deanie chap:    another lovely day
2021-06-03 09:28:14.862 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-02 19:28:24.921 Deanie chap:    I will test to see how I can make that occur
2021-06-02 19:28:14.635 Deanie chap:    Interesting but I imagine that is Win10 config
2021-06-02 17:54:37.670 Deanie chap:    I'll try it in Win10 next
2021-06-02 17:54:28.771 Deanie chap:    What happened when you dragged in? - works here using win7 on two machines
2021-06-02 17:53:33.533 Deanie chap:    as you really notice it
2021-06-02 17:53:26.388 Deanie chap:    and it is slower
2021-06-02 17:53:19.660 Deanie chap:    when you do the two together as duting a drag and drop the two are combined
2021-06-02 17:52:58.931 Deanie chap:    when you delete, same
2021-06-02 17:52:49.675 Deanie chap:    when you add an icon you will notice a short delay but it is acceptable
2021-06-02 17:52:26.249 Deanie chap:    at the moment the sequential tasks simply take time
2021-06-02 17:52:15.089 Deanie chap:    I may have to schedule some of it as a task to run later
2021-06-02 17:51:36.922 Deanie chap:    but that I believe is VB6 inability to multitask
2021-06-02 17:51:16.488 Deanie chap:    the dragging within, the drop is slow
2021-06-02 14:50:27.244 Deanie chap:    each imperfect but basically working
2021-06-02 14:50:08.157 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-02 14:50:01.180 Deanie chap:    and dragging from the dock?
2021-06-02 14:49:54.545 Deanie chap:    and dragging and dropping within the dock?
2021-06-02 14:49:40.950 Deanie chap:    Did you manage to try dragging to the dock?
2021-06-02 14:35:05.236 Deanie chap:    I need to paint
2021-06-02 14:35:02.066 Deanie chap:    so each is being cleared
2021-06-02 14:34:55.918 Deanie chap:    it is covering the windows at the back of the house
2021-06-02 14:34:35.861 Deanie chap:    gardening, removing beautiful wisteria before it lifts the tiles and rips the cast iron drainpipes from the wall
2021-06-02 14:33:59.709 Deanie chap:    just a small bug for a day that I said there would be no programming
2021-06-02 14:33:43.757 Deanie chap:    that is fixed
2021-06-02 14:33:34.236 Deanie chap:    I introduced an unexpected event when I improved the code for determining if a process was already running
2021-06-02 12:53:56.149 Deanie chap:    amending the help
2021-06-02 11:39:41.367 Deanie chap:    <><>SteamyDock.exe
2021-06-02 09:56:30.236 Deanie chap:    can't fall off
2021-06-02 09:56:25.434 Deanie chap:     alow roof
2021-06-02 09:56:22.030 Deanie chap:    a leak
2021-06-02 09:56:17.726 Deanie chap:    the roof
2021-06-02 09:56:13.896 Deanie chap:    and then to attackt ehr oof
2021-06-02 09:56:08.155 Deanie chap:    first job is to fix a puncture
2021-06-02 09:55:50.424 Deanie chap:    I have lots of jobs
2021-06-02 09:55:45.150 Deanie chap:    Summer has been so late this year
2021-06-02 09:55:34.441 Deanie chap:    I am taking a break from coding whilst the weather is good and I can manage some jobs around the house
2021-06-02 09:55:15.653 Deanie chap:    
2021-06-02 09:55:10.657 Deanie chap:    a lovely one here too
2021-06-01 19:53:17.772 Deanie chap:    to get mysefl going tomorrow

2021-06-01 19:53:04.468 Deanie chap:    tired as heck
2021-06-01 10:56:50.112 Deanie chap:    Perfect here too
2021-05-31 16:51:09.465 Deanie chap:    not always the most sensible mix
2021-05-31 16:51:02.270 Deanie chap:    beer and sun
2021-05-31 16:50:54.317 Deanie chap:    so sunburnt from yesterday
2021-05-31 12:41:13.829 Deanie chap:    so the end result is a brain dump
2021-05-31 12:41:04.009 Deanie chap:    just to get it down whilst my brain is on the subject
2021-05-31 12:40:44.281 Deanie chap:    e
2021-05-31 12:40:43.319 Deanie chap:    that is why the migration stuff is ther
2021-05-31 12:40:34.995 Deanie chap:    and it serves to focus my thoughts and put them down on paper before I forget
2021-05-31 12:40:11.242 Deanie chap:    I often write it before I create the code
2021-05-31 12:39:56.114 Deanie chap:    the help is my program documentation
2021-05-31 12:39:42.916 Deanie chap:    for me
2021-05-31 12:19:59.655 Deanie chap:    I will create a separate migration guide
2021-05-31 12:19:47.491 Deanie chap:    just to get it down
2021-05-31 12:19:37.173 Deanie chap:    with many things, I just write what comes into my head
2021-05-31 12:19:20.578 Deanie chap:    I will rewrite
2021-05-31 12:19:12.606 Deanie chap:    No not at all
2021-05-31 12:19:09.176 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-30 11:42:55.666 Deanie chap:    I will fix
2021-05-30 11:42:50.864 Deanie chap:    there will be errors
2021-05-30 11:42:46.002 Deanie chap:    thanks
2021-05-30 09:10:44.391 Deanie chap:    and tell me if they make general sense and do manage to explain what they mean to do
2021-05-30 09:10:24.994 Deanie chap:    When you get the chance please have a look at the various help files for SD
2021-05-30 09:10:05.272 Deanie chap:    friends
2021-05-30 09:09:54.490 Deanie chap:    outside for most of the day

2021-05-29 19:44:14.157 Deanie chap:    together they are 'beefy'
2021-05-29 19:44:02.852 Deanie chap:    the main ingredianet is yeat extract and often onions
2021-05-29 19:43:48.384 Deanie chap:    if you look at bisto or other similar mfg gravy
2021-05-29 19:43:34.492 Deanie chap:    it gives a good beefy taste
2021-05-29 19:43:25.000 Deanie chap:    I always use marmite as it is used as the basis of most beef stocks and gravy in any case
2021-05-29 17:38:53.931 Deanie chap:    add carrots, cabbage and other veg to the mix to give ot some texture
2021-05-29 17:38:04.847 Deanie chap:    possibly somr soy sauce
2021-05-29 17:37:53.685 Deanie chap:    to increase the beefiness
2021-05-29 17:37:44.785 Deanie chap:    marmite and worcester
2021-05-29 17:37:33.488 Deanie chap:    hmmm
2021-05-29 17:20:00.842 Deanie chap:    tiny ones
2021-05-29 17:19:52.001 Deanie chap:    a bug or two
2021-05-29 16:30:36.564 Deanie chap:    <><>SteamyDock.exe
2021-05-29 13:17:07.950 Deanie chap:    I had a single beer
2021-05-29 13:16:58.040 Deanie chap:    strange
2021-05-29 13:16:52.560 Deanie chap:    feel fine now
2021-05-29 13:16:45.294 Deanie chap:    sick
2021-05-29 13:16:43.518 Deanie chap:    bad night
2021-05-29 13:16:38.536 Deanie chap:    just woke up!
2021-05-28 18:53:04.380 Deanie chap:    but it would be good to get some hints as to whether they did the same as me
2021-05-28 18:52:44.144 Deanie chap:    I doubt it
2021-05-28 18:52:36.987 Deanie chap:    and seeing if she will give me sight of their code
2021-05-28 18:52:21.083 Deanie chap:    re: Rocketdock
2021-05-28 18:52:15.052 Deanie chap:    I am in touch with punklabs dev Skunkie
2021-05-28 18:47:21.099 Deanie chap:    shows the recent functionality improvements
2021-05-28 18:47:05.600 Deanie chap:    the right click - other - show and tell
2021-05-28 18:46:29.640 Deanie chap:    have a look at the updated help files to see the new functionality
2021-05-28 18:45:59.916 Deanie chap:    so very dull
2021-05-28 18:45:55.119 Deanie chap:    that'll be one of the last things I do!
2021-05-28 18:45:44.520 Deanie chap:    manifest
2021-05-28 18:45:41.367 Deanie chap:    that will be done with the mainfest
2021-05-28 18:45:34.164 Deanie chap:    I have yet to resolve the admin issue on Win10
2021-05-28 17:39:13.020 Deanie chap:    I just need to formalise it
2021-05-28 17:39:04.262 Deanie chap:    and it is in place here
2021-05-28 17:38:56.453 Deanie chap:    I have a solution
2021-05-28 17:38:51.492 Deanie chap:    it is one of my next tasks
2021-05-28 17:38:44.860 Deanie chap:    the instability is there
2021-05-28 17:38:32.839 Deanie chap:    oh yes
2021-05-28 17:18:33.180 Deanie chap:    new package with help and new images

2021-05-28 16:57:09.695 Deanie chap:    it miht generate an eeeor or so
2021-05-28 16:57:01.194 Deanie chap:    actually, don't do that
2021-05-28 16:46:49.145 Deanie chap:    then the dock
2021-05-28 16:46:46.229 Deanie chap:    then the icon settings
2021-05-28 16:46:41.295 Deanie chap:    run the dock settings first
2021-05-28 16:46:29.816 Deanie chap:    save the old versions first, might generate an error on first run
2021-05-28 16:46:10.174 Deanie chap:    and those into their respective folders

2021-05-28 14:45:27.208 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 14:45:25.077 Deanie chap:    but with a light cloud keeping it coolish
2021-05-28 14:45:15.016 Deanie chap:    sunny all day here
2021-05-28 14:44:55.240 Deanie chap:    that is a big one for us
2021-05-28 14:44:50.150 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 14:44:45.449 Deanie chap:    received the court order allowing us to receive Mum's money fro her pension

2021-05-28 13:46:48.187 Deanie chap:    lovely outside
2021-05-28 13:26:42.226 Deanie chap:    fixing those few new bugs in SD
2021-05-28 10:38:21.329 Deanie chap:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2tMcMQqSbA
2021-05-28 10:38:14.991 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:38:13.674 Deanie chap:    I will send you the scans of the flik o disk soon
2021-05-28 10:37:54.524 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:37:53.492 Deanie chap:    so some grinding to do
2021-05-28 10:37:46.216 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:37:43.594 Deanie chap:    but each takes significant work and research to resolve
2021-05-28 10:37:29.581 Deanie chap:    each of these task feels easy
2021-05-28 10:37:20.169 Deanie chap:    I need to do some research
2021-05-28 10:37:11.813 Deanie chap:    but that seems to tbe the one to use
2021-05-28 10:37:03.598 Deanie chap:    scaling in GDI+? Well, I did some research and tried a few others
2021-05-28 10:36:29.328 Deanie chap:    I was hoping that the choen API that can handle opactiy would act like its earlier equivalent
2021-05-28 10:36:00.364 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:35:42.652 Deanie chap:    I have scanned the flik o disk
2021-05-28 10:35:28.719 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:22:49.337 Deanie chap:    I have to scale the output somehow
2021-05-28 10:22:34.086 Deanie chap:    so it looks rather wrong
2021-05-28 10:22:26.999 Deanie chap:    the image size is shrunk but the image within  is simply translated into that box without being scaled
2021-05-28 10:21:44.976 Deanie chap:    it does what I want but it does not scale the image output like the first option
2021-05-28 10:21:14.163 Deanie chap:    you have to create a colour matrix, creat a structure to store the attributes, set them and then draw using those attributes
2021-05-28 10:20:22.497 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:20:20.001 Deanie chap:            Dim imgAttr As Long

2021-05-28 10:20:19.083 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:20:18.247 Deanie chap:    this is the code that replaces that single line
2021-05-28 10:20:08.605 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:19:44.610 Deanie chap:    I have some code to do it but I am struggling a tadge
2021-05-28 10:19:32.568 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:06:59.218 Deanie chap:    that API call has no abaility to change the opacity
2021-05-28 10:06:23.026 Deanie chap:    that takes the current image, writes it to the full screen bitmap at the x,y position and the modified width and height so it can be shrunk as required during the animation
2021-05-28 10:04:48.876 Deanie chap:    Call GdipDrawImageRectI(lngImage, lngBitmap, Left, Top, Width, Height)  ' shrinks the bitmap into the image object
2021-05-28 10:04:47.608 Deanie chap:    I currently use
2021-05-28 10:04:06.980 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-28 10:04:06.068 Deanie chap:    but for an individual icon's opacity it seems to be tricky
2021-05-28 10:03:34.772 Deanie chap:    or to change the opactity of the whole dock
2021-05-28 10:03:23.508 Deanie chap:    it is easy enough to write the image to the collection with a specifc opacity
2021-05-28 10:03:02.589 Deanie chap:    with a variable opacity
2021-05-28 10:02:50.897 Deanie chap:    I am trying to get GDI+ to extract an image from the collection and render it to the screen
2021-05-28 10:01:52.017 Deanie chap:    lovely here
2021-05-28 10:01:49.336 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-27 16:01:32.518 Deanie chap:    you can only try
2021-05-27 16:01:25.012 Deanie chap:    worth a look if your system supports it
2021-05-27 16:01:11.249 Deanie chap:    maximising Mhz!
2021-05-27 16:00:59.373 Deanie chap:    this one allows disabling of speedstep and the ability to set the cpu multiplier
2021-05-27 16:00:08.440 Deanie chap:    and on some mobos allows you to make changes
2021-05-27 15:59:56.564 Deanie chap:    it tells me what throttling the system is doing
2021-05-27 15:59:37.385 Deanie chap:    On this cpu I can use a tool called throttlestop
2021-05-27 15:58:11.698 Deanie chap:    rubbish isn't it?
2021-05-27 15:58:03.582 Deanie chap:    and hot glue the power lead
2021-05-27 15:57:49.921 Deanie chap:    buy more RAM
2021-05-27 15:57:45.239 Deanie chap:    Windows is known for this and the solution?
2021-05-27 15:57:25.652 Deanie chap:    a shutdown, power off for 15 mins then a reboot fixes everything
2021-05-27 15:56:56.670 Deanie chap:    so
2021-05-27 15:56:55.328 Deanie chap:    by windows in the previous boot
2021-05-27 15:56:42.979 Deanie chap:    as the the hardware had been placed into an indeterminate state
2021-05-27 15:56:24.171 Deanie chap:    for no reason and could not be coaxed to do more, a soft reboot was no good
2021-05-27 15:55:49.851 Deanie chap:    From that point onward ran at 2.0ghz
2021-05-27 15:55:36.476 Deanie chap:    it never quite gets over the predicament it finds itself in.
2021-05-27 15:55:14.261 Deanie chap:    even though both resolved Windows does not take well to resource limitations
2021-05-27 15:54:38.259 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-27 15:54:35.746 Deanie chap:    the power cable popped out and simultaneously the RAM usage was close to 90%
2021-05-27 15:54:05.534 Deanie chap:    needed a hard reboot and cool down
2021-05-27 15:53:50.269 Deanie chap:    just had a laptop throttling issue
2021-05-27 15:53:41.919 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-27 10:52:06.010 Deanie chap:    and running on Mac could be restored
2021-05-27 10:51:49.297 Deanie chap:    we could make the few changes that are required to fix the security issues
2021-05-27 10:51:31.250 Deanie chap:    if only we had the code for the YWE
2021-05-27 10:51:11.369 Deanie chap:    on Macs
2021-05-27 10:51:04.978 Deanie chap:    it also gives you a method of retaining widget development as a credible thing to do
2021-05-27 10:50:33.383 Deanie chap:    ensuring your code works on another platform
2021-05-27 10:49:59.308 Deanie chap:    and an extremely rugged test environment
2021-05-27 10:49:39.459 Deanie chap:    and quite advanced!
2021-05-27 10:49:31.944 Deanie chap:    that is an unusual set up
2021-05-27 10:49:12.556 Deanie chap:    so you are cross platform editing and debugging?
2021-05-27 10:48:46.408 Deanie chap:    That's clever
2021-05-27 10:16:58.004 Deanie chap:    g
2021-05-27 10:16:56.628 Deanie chap:    or rather confiurable
2021-05-27 10:16:48.990 Deanie chap:    it is massively extensible
2021-05-27 10:16:41.800 Deanie chap:    and I stick to that and ignore te rest
2021-05-27 10:16:33.455 Deanie chap:    but I had a reasonable set up
2021-05-27 10:16:19.510 Deanie chap:    yes
2021-05-27 09:26:43.549 Deanie chap:    it is a step toward having an IDE!
2021-05-27 09:26:30.088 Deanie chap:    that discloses the debug menu and allows you to restart at will as normal
2021-05-27 09:25:57.918 Deanie chap:    if the YWE is in debug mode
2021-05-27 09:25:44.787 Deanie chap:    that means I can open the proj at any time and run or re-run the widget
2021-05-27 09:25:14.512 Deanie chap:    there is a green triangle button "run project without build"
2021-05-27 09:24:40.345 Deanie chap:    the customise option
2021-05-27 09:24:29.048 Deanie chap:    right click and edit
2021-05-27 09:24:23.331 Deanie chap:    on the main toolbar
2021-05-27 09:24:16.007 Deanie chap:    then
2021-05-27 09:23:57.673 Deanie chap:    cut and paste the full path and name of the .kon file
2021-05-27 09:23:35.452 Deanie chap:    project - configuration - run
2021-05-27 09:23:16.666 Deanie chap:    then
2021-05-27 09:23:13.246 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-27 09:23:10.841 Deanie chap:    Once you have created a project  - project - new  (then add your widget folder
2021-05-27 09:22:06.116 Deanie chap:    in RJTExtEd there is an option to run your code
2021-05-27 09:21:52.845 Deanie chap:    morning
2021-05-27 09:21:48.527 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 22:12:14.875 Deanie chap:    quite useful
2021-05-26 22:12:07.367 Deanie chap:    time
2021-05-26 22:12:05.347 Deanie chap:    just like the last itme
2021-05-26 22:11:52.951 Deanie chap:    and open the widget's project ready to edit
2021-05-26 22:11:34.970 Deanie chap:    so I can then use the right click menu on the widget
2021-05-26 22:11:19.014 Deanie chap:    into the default editor field in prefs
2021-05-26 22:10:56.570 Deanie chap:    I add the path to the .rjproj file
2021-05-26 22:10:43.400 Deanie chap:    in the widget itself
2021-05-26 22:10:06.823 Deanie chap:    previously
2021-05-26 22:09:59.368 Deanie chap:    a double click on the .rjproj file opens up your project at the last position and files that you had open
2021-05-26 22:09:21.501 Deanie chap:    so I have one project for each widget
2021-05-26 22:09:07.883 Deanie chap:    then I load the whole widget folder into the project
2021-05-26 22:08:51.341 Deanie chap:    I create 'project' for each widget
2021-05-26 22:08:37.567 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 22:08:19.944 Deanie chap:    and RJtextEd for all .js development for YWE
2021-05-26 22:08:03.580 Deanie chap:    I use context as my notepad replacement
2021-05-26 22:07:47.359 Deanie chap:    which will be fast to operate like Context
2021-05-26 22:07:27.474 Deanie chap:    The new chap Rickard is coming up with an RJtextedLite
2021-05-26 22:07:05.846 Deanie chap:    both Delphi apps
2021-05-26 22:06:59.493 Deanie chap:    and the reason it was similar? because the dev based it upon Context
2021-05-26 22:06:34.174 Deanie chap:    in functionality
2021-05-26 22:06:30.446 Deanie chap:    it is slower to load as it is a lot bigger
2021-05-26 22:06:18.238 Deanie chap:    and when that dev gave up, switched to RJtextEd as I found it similar to Context
2021-05-26 22:05:39.022 Deanie chap:    I did all my original .ja coding using Context
2021-05-26 21:31:22.052 Deanie chap:    then you have my set up
2021-05-26 21:31:10.789 Deanie chap:    backup the old first
2021-05-26 21:31:02.851 Deanie chap:     put that in \AppData\Roaming\RJ TextEd
2021-05-26 21:30:48.635 Deanie chap:    That is my .ini file
2021-05-26 21:30:39.095 Deanie chap:    <><>TextEd.ini
2021-05-26 18:53:31.229 Deanie chap:    <><>RJ TextEd.zip
2021-05-26 18:52:40.200 Deanie chap:    wrong zip
2021-05-26 18:52:36.943 Deanie chap:    sorry
2021-05-26 17:51:21.323 Deanie chap:    see if that helps
2021-05-26 17:51:17.870 Deanie chap:    try disabling the a/v for a short time
2021-05-26 17:50:59.115 Deanie chap:    never a problem
2021-05-26 17:50:55.165 Deanie chap:    I have installed it on seven to ten systems all different
2021-05-26 17:50:35.613 Deanie chap:    must be worth raising
2021-05-26 17:50:29.939 Deanie chap:    how strange
2021-05-26 17:38:23.948 Deanie chap:    older version or it
2021-05-26 17:38:18.186 Deanie chap:    try unzipping that in its place
2021-05-26 17:37:59.712 Deanie chap:    <><>RJ TextEd.zip
2021-05-26 17:36:37.250 Deanie chap:    I have no vcl260.bpl on my system
2021-05-26 17:36:24.508 Deanie chap:    he is very responsive to bugs
2021-05-26 17:36:16.631 Deanie chap:    but there was a new relase yesterday so it may have a bug
2021-05-26 17:36:00.425 Deanie chap:    always upgrading
2021-05-26 17:35:54.170 Deanie chap:    en't installed from scratch for a long time
2021-05-26 17:35:43.449 Deanie chap:    I hav
2021-05-26 17:35:13.401 Deanie chap:    64bit?
2021-05-26 17:35:05.278 Deanie chap:    very strange
2021-05-26 15:13:34.589 Deanie chap:    and definitely a master of none
2021-05-26 15:13:27.002 Deanie chap:    RJTextEd is a superb editor but it is a Jack of all Trades
2021-05-26 15:12:47.350 Deanie chap:    that it feels so clunky and slow to have to search manually for everything you need
2021-05-26 15:12:25.792 Deanie chap:     way of doing things
2021-05-26 15:12:18.795 Deanie chap:    I have now reverted so much to the old VB6 IDE
2021-05-26 15:11:54.775 Deanie chap:    and it so sad that it was never created
2021-05-26 15:11:40.408 Deanie chap:    The killer app for YWE would have been an IDE
2021-05-26 15:11:26.077 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 15:11:24.674 Deanie chap:    in comparison
2021-05-26 15:11:21.469 Deanie chap:    so easy
2021-05-26 15:11:14.696 Deanie chap:    or the same on an image/control in the forms designer and be taken straight to the associated events in code
2021-05-26 15:10:32.179 Deanie chap:    and be taken directly to it
2021-05-26 15:10:17.375 Deanie chap:    where I can double click on a function call
2021-05-26 15:10:03.439 Deanie chap:    I have become SO used to a RAD IDE
2021-05-26 15:09:54.338 Deanie chap:    and I had forgotten how slow the development process was
2021-05-26 15:09:40.205 Deanie chap:    I am trying to make a few changes using RJTextEd to the .js
2021-05-26 15:09:20.333 Deanie chap:    on the widget front
2021-05-26 15:09:16.188 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 15:09:13.169 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 15:09:09.026 Deanie chap:    but isn't that what they all do?]
2021-05-26 15:09:00.811 Deanie chap:    and the PM was a fool for surrounding himself with fools
2021-05-26 15:08:46.640 Deanie chap:    Cummings was a fool, and is a fool
2021-05-26 15:08:10.897 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 15:08:07.996 Deanie chap:    where were they at the time?
2021-05-26 15:07:53.306 Deanie chap:    same thing in the US when everyone turned on Trump but only after he was voted out
2021-05-26 15:07:28.366 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 15:07:20.901 Deanie chap:    just to damage their current opponents
2021-05-26 15:06:58.984 Deanie chap:    when they will say one thing one day, and something else another
2021-05-26 15:06:44.240 Deanie chap:    this is when I despise politics
2021-05-26 15:06:34.815 Deanie chap:    getting his revenge
2021-05-26 15:06:28.580 Deanie chap:    amongst the little worms
2021-05-26 15:06:21.840 Deanie chap:    He is a little worm
2021-05-26 13:33:37.053 Deanie chap:    back soon
2021-05-26 13:33:33.163 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 13:33:16.336 Deanie chap:    it seems as if it is this systray icon existence that it is baulking over
2021-05-26 13:32:54.033 Deanie chap:    and sometimes up to 5 depending upon how many times it has restarted
2021-05-26 13:32:30.567 Deanie chap:    still has the YWE systray icon within it
2021-05-26 13:32:13.304 Deanie chap:    the systray
2021-05-26 13:32:08.853 Deanie chap:    however, I noticed that when the YWE has died it leaves on element within running Windows
2021-05-26 13:31:37.318 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 13:31:36.228 Deanie chap:    but it still occurs sometimes even when no yahooWidget.exe processes exist
2021-05-26 13:31:08.532 Deanie chap:     it is the kill button xwidget
2021-05-26 13:30:58.655 Deanie chap:    and it kills all yahooWidget.exe processes during that situation
2021-05-26 13:30:35.774 Deanie chap:    I have a Xwidget - is it an Xwidget?
2021-05-26 13:30:21.178 Deanie chap:    some remaining processe still survive and when it attempts to restart these processes then cause YWE to crash and restart again and again
2021-05-26 13:29:44.805 Deanie chap:    but this is often not the case
2021-05-26 13:29:37.571 Deanie chap:    processes should exist
2021-05-26 13:29:30.214 Deanie chap:    no yahooWidgets.exe
2021-05-26 13:29:23.386 Deanie chap:    when the YWE dies it should leave no traces
2021-05-26 13:29:10.536 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 13:29:09.051 Deanie chap:    it does not happen often so quite difficult to track down
2021-05-26 13:28:53.896 Deanie chap:    I found one of the situations where the YWE fails to restart after a crash
2021-05-26 13:28:29.963 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-26 13:00:30.953 Deanie chap:    new version of startup manager working fine
2021-05-26 11:16:48.808 Deanie chap:    adding a message box to widget deletion
2021-05-26 11:16:36.854 Deanie chap:    small changes
2021-05-26 11:16:33.804 Deanie chap:    making changes to startup manager
2021-05-25 19:50:23.966 Deanie chap:    I have it
2021-05-25 18:09:25.955 Deanie chap:    which version is it?
2021-05-25 18:09:19.834 Deanie chap:    there is a new version of startup manager is there not?
2021-05-25 18:09:09.605 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 18:09:08.057 Deanie chap:    I have some minor bugs to fix/changes to make
2021-05-25 18:08:55.527 Deanie chap:    and use it as I used to
2021-05-25 18:08:48.435 Deanie chap:    and that I can open my yahoo widget projects correctly
2021-05-25 18:08:25.485 Deanie chap:    setting up RJTextEd and ensuring the config. is correct
2021-05-25 18:08:05.992 Deanie chap:    I am getting my dev environment for widgets set up again
2021-05-25 14:34:53.075 Deanie chap:    a flexible boss
2021-05-25 14:34:46.405 Deanie chap:    That's the way it should be
2021-05-25 13:51:08.237 Deanie chap:    but we never failed to make it work
2021-05-25 13:50:53.561 Deanie chap:    using that tool
2021-05-25 13:50:44.369 Deanie chap:    it was quite scary tapping into a thick ethernet cable
2021-05-25 13:50:29.020 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 13:50:19.059 Deanie chap:    quite a powerful scripting language not dissimilar to BASIC in some respects
2021-05-25 13:49:53.381 Deanie chap:    I did some good coding using DCL
2021-05-25 13:49:35.500 Deanie chap:    and then scripting using DCL and DOS batch
2021-05-25 13:49:22.135 Deanie chap:    I was still experimenting with languages using various z80 BASICs and GW-Basic on the PC
2021-05-25 13:48:50.796 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 13:48:36.757 Deanie chap:    .js is RAD!
2021-05-25 13:48:16.916 Deanie chap:    the rest of it was probably too advanced for me at that point
2021-05-25 13:47:45.380 Deanie chap:    as he used to say that code will be read far more often than it will be written
2021-05-25 13:47:24.244 Deanie chap:    and the use of commenting blocks to comment the code
2021-05-25 13:47:03.105 Deanie chap:    but I now realise the only thing that really went in were the importance of strong typing in languages
2021-05-25 13:46:34.478 Deanie chap:    I did a couple of ADA courses
2021-05-25 13:46:16.190 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 13:45:52.379 Deanie chap:    that you had to drill into to get a connection
2021-05-25 13:45:27.083 Deanie chap:    all running via TCP/IP on thick wire ethernet
2021-05-25 13:44:55.499 Deanie chap:    then apollo domain DX
2021-05-25 13:44:34.272 Deanie chap:    Worked up all my 'puting skills from z80 to IBM PCs and Vax 11/750
2021-05-25 13:43:19.859 Deanie chap:    I worked for him at Alsys from 1985 to 1990
2021-05-25 13:42:59.092 Deanie chap:    He's a nice chap
2021-05-25 11:41:29.741 Deanie chap:    "On approximately June 1, 2021, the free Yahoo Weather API will be retired and will cease to function. Unfortunately, we will not be offering a replacement API, and there will be no paid alternative."
2021-05-25 11:41:26.223 Deanie chap:    changing subject rapidly today
2021-05-25 11:41:01.048 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 11:40:58.611 Deanie chap:    I used to work woth John Barnes
2021-05-25 11:26:23.810 Deanie chap:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcsbKiyTvcw
2021-05-25 11:26:22.012 Deanie chap:    John Barnes
2021-05-25 11:26:18.498 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 11:18:28.428 Deanie chap:    and final announcment late last year
2021-05-25 11:16:44.044 Deanie chap:    Yhoo stopped development and support
2021-05-25 11:16:31.285 Deanie chap:    the tech has come to an end
2021-05-25 11:16:23.405 Deanie chap:    after a lot of sales with many TVs
2021-05-25 11:16:11.298 Deanie chap:    YWE on TVs appears to be dead
2021-05-25 11:15:20.490 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 11:15:18.852 Deanie chap:    worth reading the BBC
2021-05-25 11:15:08.942 Deanie chap:    have you seen the furure about the games companies and their battle with Apple that is in the courts now?
2021-05-25 11:14:42.472 Deanie chap:    I don't like their way of dong business
2021-05-25 11:14:27.852 Deanie chap:    he signed an agreement
2021-05-25 11:14:18.477 Deanie chap:    as Apple forbids its devs from contributing to FOSS
2021-05-25 11:14:07.237 Deanie chap:    and he had to leave ReactOS team permanently
2021-05-25 11:13:50.891 Deanie chap:    as one of the their team heads
2021-05-25 11:13:43.330 Deanie chap:    one of the ReactOS team, a kernel developer has been snatched up by Apple
2021-05-25 11:13:24.209 Deanie chap:    in their approach and design
2021-05-25 11:13:14.821 Deanie chap:    as they seem to be non-me
2021-05-25 11:13:06.469 Deanie chap:    I just don't look at their products in general
2021-05-25 11:12:56.615 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 11:12:41.477 Deanie chap:    I have been keeping up with what Apple is doing with processors though
2021-05-25 11:12:24.450 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 11:12:22.334 Deanie chap:    ten I can afford it as the price drop is large
2021-05-25 11:12:04.959 Deanie chap:    until it three to five years old
2021-05-25 11:11:54.546 Deanie chap:    I never look at anything from Apple
2021-05-25 10:28:29.980 Deanie chap:    " you won't be fired if you buy IBM "
2021-05-25 10:28:08.827 Deanie chap:    and following a corporation's design philosopphy and technology cannot be denied
2021-05-25 10:27:15.601 Deanie chap:    the problem is people are too conventional
2021-05-25 10:26:57.013 Deanie chap:    he was surprised and understood
2021-05-25 10:26:37.509 Deanie chap:    but explained the concepts and reasoning
2021-05-25 10:26:20.937 Deanie chap:    entirely
2021-05-25 10:26:12.469 Deanie chap:    when I told him it was obsolete tech
2021-05-25 10:25:57.266 Deanie chap:    and the MAC-style dock impressed too
2021-05-25 10:25:37.009 Deanie chap:    he thought it was years ahead of what he is doing with square boxes in VB.NET
2021-05-25 10:25:09.495 Deanie chap:    and was surprised by the capability of  YWE to place non-square apps so easily in the desktop using .js
2021-05-25 10:24:31.169 Deanie chap:    he asaid he'd never seen anything like it
2021-05-25 10:24:22.134 Deanie chap:    and he saw my desktop and was overcome!
2021-05-25 10:24:10.985 Deanie chap:    I had a VB.NET proigrammer drop in to say hello
2021-05-25 10:24:00.747 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 10:23:51.390 Deanie chap:    I think you are right
2021-05-25 10:23:35.228 Deanie chap:    but I still need a replacement for .js on the desktop
2021-05-25 10:23:14.461 Deanie chap:    eventually
2021-05-25 10:23:11.133 Deanie chap:    and the desktop with my dock on Linux!
2021-05-25 10:22:55.607 Deanie chap:    ReactOS for YWE eventually
2021-05-25 10:22:44.801 Deanie chap:    I aim to use a Win7 VM for photoshop
2021-05-25 10:22:29.073 Deanie chap:    and also my favourite design tool Photoshop
2021-05-25 10:22:18.869 Deanie chap:    and YWE
2021-05-25 10:22:13.144 Deanie chap:    but I have to find a replacement for VB6 (coming)
2021-05-25 10:21:57.773 Deanie chap:    when Win7 is no longer safe
2021-05-25 10:21:46.593 Deanie chap:    and tha is still my ultimate aim
2021-05-25 10:21:35.537 Deanie chap:    My boy has just migrated to Linux, KDE
2021-05-25 10:21:10.606 Deanie chap:    "the package"
2021-05-25 10:20:56.062 Deanie chap:    it seems no replacement for the ease of use, programmability, configurability of YWE and its many APIs
2021-05-25 10:20:23.957 Deanie chap:    but
2021-05-25 10:20:21.480 Deanie chap:    I understand.
2021-05-25 10:19:54.210 Deanie chap:    and Wanda, the fish as a screen protection from burn=out
2021-05-25 10:19:31.621 Deanie chap:    that kills all yahoowidgets.exe processes when they go rogue
2021-05-25 10:19:15.691 Deanie chap:    volume and my kill button
2021-05-25 10:19:03.800 Deanie chap:    I have three xwidgets still
2021-05-25 10:18:57.317 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 10:18:45.729 Deanie chap:    and I retain the original clock/calendar as it is still my favourite
2021-05-25 10:18:11.057 Deanie chap:    the flip clock does its job
2021-05-25 10:18:02.178 Deanie chap:    the clocks and calendars of which we have so many are pretty and utilised the least I think
2021-05-25 10:17:27.122 Deanie chap:    and I have been using that daily
2021-05-25 10:17:09.163 Deanie chap:    we have been having some problems with competing wifi from other homes
2021-05-25 10:16:53.282 Deanie chap:    The wirelss gauge shows the wireless signal strength so clearly
2021-05-25 10:16:22.494 Deanie chap:    the browser is such a downgrade for such a dynamic desktop
2021-05-25 10:15:52.701 Deanie chap:    and the RAM and CPU gauges are indispensable
2021-05-25 10:15:27.070 Deanie chap:    strangely...
2021-05-25 10:15:20.348 Deanie chap:    the moon widget is used all the time
2021-05-25 10:15:05.118 Deanie chap:    as is my media player
2021-05-25 10:14:58.478 Deanie chap:    the weather widegt is essential
2021-05-25 10:14:48.143 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 10:14:44.350 Deanie chap:    I use the desktop hole all the time!
2021-05-25 10:14:36.239 Deanie chap:    and I have found nothing to equal it
2021-05-25 10:14:27.062 Deanie chap:    With Win7 and YWE my desktop is as productive as it ever was
2021-05-25 10:14:13.210 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 10:14:01.215 Deanie chap:    as it uses the MS Trident engine/VB scripting to underpin what it does
2021-05-25 10:13:27.531 Deanie chap:    I wonder how that will affect the Xwidget program?
2021-05-25 10:13:08.711 Deanie chap:    but retaining some of the components that are used in programming
2021-05-25 10:12:47.955 Deanie chap:    MS is removing internet explorer from Win10
2021-05-25 10:12:27.925 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 10:12:03.898 Deanie chap:    as it is clearly a dead end
2021-05-25 10:11:58.296 Deanie chap:    I cannot use Rainmeter
2021-05-25 10:11:50.238 Deanie chap:    I still cannot believe we do not have a YWE replacement, .js on the desktop!
2021-05-25 10:11:04.323 Deanie chap:    a couple of regressions to fix first
2021-05-25 10:10:53.418 Deanie chap:    time for another update I think
2021-05-25 10:10:47.684 Deanie chap:    SD is coming on
2021-05-25 10:10:41.960 Deanie chap:    as time allows
2021-05-25 10:10:32.707 Deanie chap:    but only for my own usage
2021-05-25 10:10:26.607 Deanie chap:    and I will improve them over time
2021-05-25 10:10:12.170 Deanie chap:    I will not stop using them on Windows
2021-05-25 09:55:32.351 Deanie chap:    sometimes I could do with a clone of myself
2021-05-25 09:55:18.942 Deanie chap:    I have cloned many times
2021-05-25 09:55:13.723 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 09:55:02.615 Deanie chap:    putting a few days between yourself and the problem is also a sensible approach
2021-05-25 09:54:43.377 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 09:54:32.934 Deanie chap:    as to the pitfalls
2021-05-25 09:54:21.894 Deanie chap:    later when you decide to transfer the o/s to the SSD I have some experience
2021-05-25 09:53:58.519 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 09:53:47.818 Deanie chap:    that is a sensible approach
2021-05-25 09:03:49.488 Deanie chap:    to get both drives to be accessible
2021-05-25 09:03:34.732 Deanie chap:    so it is probably worth staying with the RAID and configuring that
2021-05-25 09:03:16.064 Deanie chap:    in my experience it was a problem
2021-05-25 09:03:06.941 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 09:03:05.742 Deanie chap:    though some say they have
2021-05-25 09:02:59.830 Deanie chap:    and it does not seem to possible to fix that
2021-05-25 09:02:49.406 Deanie chap:    so the o/s will not boot witthe new interface
2021-05-25 09:02:39.916 Deanie chap:    when an o/s is installed under RAID or AHCI, when switching to another interface you find essential components are missing from the o/s or configured incorrectly
2021-05-25 09:01:53.829 Deanie chap:    one thing to note:
2021-05-25 09:01:47.876 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 09:01:45.496 Deanie chap:    I have two drives installed and it took some jiggeri pokeri in order to get it to recognise both and boot
2021-05-25 09:01:05.579 Deanie chap:    I don't know why
2021-05-25 09:00:00.630 Deanie chap:    my laptop came that way
2021-05-25 08:59:52.450 Deanie chap:    I have a Dell with the RAID s/w installed
2021-05-25 08:59:42.617 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-25 08:59:40.707 Deanie chap:    ensure your data is backed up beforehand
2021-05-25 08:59:30.637 Deanie chap:    and just be careful
2021-05-25 08:59:24.190 Deanie chap:    I would do some searching on t'net
2021-05-25 08:58:52.176 Deanie chap:    if not possible then some playing around will get it going
2021-05-25 08:58:38.232 Deanie chap:    SSD location
2021-05-25 08:58:29.489 Deanie chap:    I suggest you put that formatted on another system (if possible) in the
2021-05-25 08:58:05.006 Deanie chap:    but it should still be possible to insert the drive into that space, formatted
2021-05-25 08:57:23.577 Deanie chap:    AHCI is the interface normally used by modern PCs to access requests to/from the drive
2021-05-25 08:56:00.763 Deanie chap:    if the drive is uninitialised then the software will use the drive as a virtual cached drive
2021-05-25 08:55:30.119 Deanie chap:    that means that the drives will all be treated as one
2021-05-25 08:55:14.628 Deanie chap:    The machine is using RAID 0 to present the drives to the o/s
2021-05-24 21:16:37.466 Deanie chap:    cloning would probably be best
2021-05-24 21:16:27.304 Deanie chap:    or reinstall it upon the new mSATA SSD
2021-05-24 21:16:11.942 Deanie chap:    you can then clone the o/s to the new SSD
2021-05-24 21:15:53.011 Deanie chap:    then the system will see it
2021-05-24 21:15:47.141 Deanie chap:    or format it elsewhere
2021-05-24 21:15:37.528 Deanie chap:    I believe that if you place another SSD of the same type in that bay and format it
2021-05-24 21:15:06.857 Deanie chap:    The cache is only needed if you have a traditional hard drive that is slow
2021-05-24 21:14:44.405 Deanie chap:

2021-05-24 21:14:30.622 Deanie chap:    but this looks to be what you need to do
2021-05-24 21:14:08.861 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-24 21:14:00.229 Deanie chap:    your new device, please re-send me the details of what you bought
2021-05-24 21:13:41.106 Deanie chap:    If you put your SSD in its plac
2021-05-24 21:13:22.902 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-24 21:13:16.269 Deanie chap:    and the DEll software recognises it and uses as cache
2021-05-24 21:12:53.226 Deanie chap:    the drive is just inserted without a format
2021-05-24 21:12:40.135 Deanie chap:    the SSD caches some of your data
2021-05-24 21:12:31.604 Deanie chap:    The hard drive is a standard rotating disc
2021-05-24 21:06:39.720 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-24 21:06:37.010 Deanie chap:    I see what you have sent now
2021-05-24 21:05:22.370 Deanie chap:    and show you the devices
2021-05-24 21:05:16.990 Deanie chap:    device manager should pop up
2021-05-24 21:05:09.197 Deanie chap:    start menu - run - type devmgmt at the command line
2021-05-24 21:04:30.749 Deanie chap:    go to device manager
2021-05-24 21:04:25.368 Deanie chap:    so there are no other drives?
2021-05-24 21:04:16.535 Deanie chap:    correct
2021-05-24 19:12:18.764 Deanie chap:    select C: right click, properties, hardware
2021-05-24 19:11:37.404 Deanie chap:    and which phys. device does that sit upon?
2021-05-24 17:53:11.845 Deanie chap:    and where does the o/s reside, upon which physical device?
2021-05-24 17:52:53.410 Deanie chap:    how many drives do you have?
2021-05-24 17:52:34.714 Deanie chap:    they are standard devices
2021-05-24 17:52:27.083 Deanie chap:    I can see it
2021-05-24 17:52:00.019 Deanie chap:    the SSD, whaty type is it?
2021-05-24 17:51:35.145 Deanie chap:    no piccie yet
2021-05-23 15:44:21.253 Deanie chap:    with cast aluminium
2021-05-23 15:44:14.560 Deanie chap:    which you would expect
2021-05-23 15:44:09.222 Deanie chap:    and it snapped when pushing it home
2021-05-23 15:43:55.819 Deanie chap:    the bushing was too tight on one side
2021-05-23 15:43:33.747 Deanie chap:    naughty
2021-05-23 15:43:28.105 Deanie chap:    it should have a bracing rod from one side of the bracket to the other
2021-05-23 15:43:06.349 Deanie chap:    you'll see the bracket is a point of weakness for a cast part
2021-05-23 15:42:43.992 Deanie chap:    <><>189276423_779829686238008_8973268759708333978_n.jpg

2021-05-23 15:39:55.905 Deanie chap:    well, yes
2021-05-23 14:37:03.719 Deanie chap:    so I am thinking how to fix it
2021-05-23 14:36:55.050 Deanie chap:    the part should have had reinforcement but it has none
2021-05-23 14:36:10.854 Deanie chap:    I said beforehand cast aluminium is the wrong material for garden furniture as the weak points will be under stress from heavy humans
2021-05-23 14:35:19.863 Deanie chap:    Lucy is now cross with me!
2021-05-23 14:35:12.374 Deanie chap:    especially aluminium
2021-05-23 14:34:45.001 Deanie chap:    is not good for cast items
2021-05-23 14:34:34.004 Deanie chap:    shearing force
2021-05-23 14:34:30.040 Deanie chap:    was greater than the aluminium could take
2021-05-23 14:33:54.196 Deanie chap:    as the force required to get it in the hole
2021-05-23 14:33:37.011 Deanie chap:    and it snapped
2021-05-23 14:33:34.057 Deanie chap:    was pushed into place
2021-05-23 14:33:28.960 Deanie chap:    a push fit item
2021-05-23 14:33:01.063 Deanie chap:    cast aluminium is so weak
2021-05-23 14:32:52.732 Deanie chap:    assembling it
2021-05-23 14:32:48.275 Deanie chap:    just broke a cast aluminium garden chair
2021-05-23 09:31:23.466 Deanie chap:    sunny this morning - not lasting though
2021-05-22 13:23:18.419 Deanie chap:    your life = my life

2021-05-22 12:08:58.304 Deanie chap:    very little coding
2021-05-22 12:08:52.509 Deanie chap:    relaxing today

2021-05-20 21:56:55.769 Deanie chap:    I have tested - all works
2021-05-20 21:56:48.453 Deanie chap:    useful for full screen apps like games
2021-05-20 21:56:39.704 Deanie chap:    that hides the dock before the application starts
2021-05-20 21:56:20.548 Deanie chap:    and the other is dock autohide
2021-05-20 21:56:10.826 Deanie chap:    that runs before the bounce animation is complete
2021-05-20 21:55:55.601 Deanie chap:    first being quick launch

2021-05-20 21:55:08.368 Deanie chap:    I will do the timer just not now
2021-05-20 21:54:57.072 Deanie chap:    That vid was interesting
2021-05-20 21:54:48.017 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-20 16:49:50.310 Deanie chap:    but it does look good

2021-05-20 16:49:18.240 Deanie chap:    and it looks the job
2021-05-20 16:49:10.790 Deanie chap:    but it is working as you suggest
2021-05-20 16:48:03.996 Deanie chap:    it
2021-05-20 16:48:02.352 Deanie chap:    I'll have to make ti
2021-05-20 16:47:55.649 Deanie chap:    but a countdown for 1hr is still the requirement
2021-05-20 16:47:36.067 Deanie chap:    sets a target time
2021-05-20 16:44:04.722 Deanie chap:    Oh, that's nice
2021-05-20 16:31:17.211 Deanie chap:    weatherwise

2021-05-20 16:30:56.180 Deanie chap:    or cooking timer
2021-05-20 16:30:49.049 Deanie chap:    like one of those dark room clocks
2021-05-20 16:30:40.335 Deanie chap:    with a button on top somewhere to make it 'go'
2021-05-20 16:30:21.229 Deanie chap:    mins and secs
2021-05-20 16:30:10.279 Deanie chap:    and then only the two faces
2021-05-20 16:30:04.750 Deanie chap:    countdown duration is what is needed
2021-05-20 16:29:36.705 Deanie chap:    perhaps I have an old version
2021-05-20 16:29:28.393 Deanie chap:    I tried that
2021-05-20 16:29:25.988 Deanie chap:    Does it?
2021-05-20 16:00:47.913 Deanie chap:    I have the old standard flip clock running all the time now
2021-05-20 16:00:17.252 Deanie chap:    and an hourly timer would be very useful
2021-05-20 16:00:01.810 Deanie chap:    I make free phone calls under an hour
2021-05-20 15:59:54.258 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-20 15:59:53.619 Deanie chap:    It is almost right but not quite
2021-05-20 15:59:09.253 Deanie chap:    rather than a time and alarm
2021-05-20 15:59:01.851 Deanie chap:    and of course I want a count down

2021-05-20 15:23:11.711 Deanie chap:    will watch when quiet

2021-05-20 14:45:32.860 Deanie chap:    must be doing 80mph
2021-05-20 14:44:31.837 Deanie chap:    no gates on those crossings
2021-05-20 14:43:33.344 Deanie chap:    I suppose there must be
2021-05-20 14:42:42.842 Deanie chap:    are there that many crossings?
2021-05-20 14:42:30.006 Deanie chap:    that loco driver is losing a lot of steam using that whistle
2021-05-20 14:42:12.563 Deanie chap:    the whistle sound is often a stock sound from US trains that have a distinctive sound not found in UK steam
2021-05-20 14:41:43.446 Deanie chap:    one thing that always annoys me in US made films meant to be set in the UK when a steamtrain appears
2021-05-20 14:41:16.011 Deanie chap:    American roads and railways - dead straight
2021-05-20 14:40:56.574 Deanie chap:    let's hope the driver of the car was looking the correct direction

2021-05-19 09:17:35.606 Deanie chap:    I will implement shortly

2021-05-18 15:09:41.694 Deanie chap:    been extremely busy here today do all help is useful

2021-05-18 15:09:21.897 Deanie chap:    I will give that a go
2021-05-18 15:09:05.156 Deanie chap:    Thankyou Harry
2021-05-18 12:34:52.163 Deanie chap:    just a thought
2021-05-18 12:34:23.880 Deanie chap:    to a timer that is triggered a few seconds later by a flag
2021-05-18 12:33:59.801 Deanie chap:    on SD to speed up the drag and drop I could move the saving of the data
2021-05-18 12:33:56.562 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-18 12:33:50.184 Deanie chap:    I did something like that in my pendulum too if I remember
2021-05-18 12:32:47.053 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-18 12:10:28.283 Deanie chap:    and that would be fine
2021-05-18 12:10:22.351 Deanie chap:    as examples
2021-05-18 12:10:18.966 Deanie chap:    they could be implemented in .js
2021-05-18 12:10:08.356 Deanie chap:    I would just like some alternatives
2021-05-18 12:09:57.898 Deanie chap:    it works smoothly
2021-05-18 12:09:52.505 Deanie chap:    it is very similar to the .js I had previously

2021-05-18 12:06:06.920 Deanie chap:    Do you fancy coming up with some bounce code for me?
2021-05-18 10:03:39.784 Deanie chap:    and now I think I won't
2021-05-18 10:03:32.062 Deanie chap:    I was just thinking of replacing ours
2021-05-18 10:03:18.214 Deanie chap:    new gas boilers being made obsolete by 2025, ours dates from 1978
2021-05-18 10:03:09.233 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-18 10:02:18.444 Deanie chap:    There being no objects with properties I cannot simply amend them, I have to store and handle those manually
2021-05-18 10:01:43.096 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-18 10:01:21.196 Deanie chap:    and the prettier animations can come
2021-05-18 10:01:07.409 Deanie chap:    then I can do some transformations
2021-05-18 10:00:52.018 Deanie chap:    and I can derive all the x,y values and have storage for each
2021-05-18 10:00:28.027 Deanie chap:    I only need array for the top and bottom values the latter of which will be mostly static
2021-05-18 09:59:54.114 Deanie chap:    I had already added an array to store the right hand x pos of each icon
2021-05-18 09:59:09.803 Deanie chap:    as I can't easily transform an element whose co-ords aren't known
2021-05-18 09:58:46.633 Deanie chap:    so animation of any complexity is going to be difficult
2021-05-18 09:58:29.140 Deanie chap:    the co-ords aren't even derived actually, they could be but at the moment they aren't
2021-05-18 09:58:06.291 Deanie chap:    when the icons are sized
2021-05-18 09:57:52.224 Deanie chap:    the other co-ordinates are not known but derived
2021-05-18 09:57:27.091 Deanie chap:    so I am storing the x value of one side
2021-05-18 09:57:06.262 Deanie chap:    s
2021-05-18 09:57:01.117 Deanie chap:    all other calcs are derived from the position of the cursor from the left hand x position of the main icon
2021-05-18 09:56:32.161 Deanie chap:    no other data is stored about the icon position
2021-05-18 09:56:13.723 Deanie chap:    at the moment it is all done rather frugally being based upon the left hand position of each icon
2021-05-18 09:55:37.914 Deanie chap:    I had a bit of a realisation, a rather obvious one really re: the dock animation
2021-05-18 09:55:18.460 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-18 09:46:49.877 Deanie chap:    lovely here too
2021-05-17 22:57:49.882 Deanie chap:    good night
2021-05-17 16:37:10.212 Deanie chap:    VSCode is at least FOSS and customisable
2021-05-17 16:36:49.430 Deanie chap:    MS visual studio is overblown and overweight
2021-05-17 16:36:26.532 Deanie chap:    never quite sure of either change
2021-05-17 16:36:11.349 Deanie chap:    we went from blackboards to whiteboards but IDEs turned from white to black
2021-05-17 16:35:40.839 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-17 16:35:39.641 Deanie chap:    I am not fond of that new mode that most editors seem to sport these days
2021-05-17 16:35:18.693 Deanie chap:    I believe it is possible to theme it
2021-05-17 12:23:43.142 Deanie chap:    and optimising the code as well
2021-05-17 12:23:34.851 Deanie chap:    so speeding the process up slwoly
2021-05-17 12:23:24.609 Deanie chap:    it now only does it once
2021-05-17 12:23:14.727 Deanie chap:    and when saving to the dockSettings.ini file, it used to do it once durign the add and once after the delete
2021-05-17 12:22:45.339 Deanie chap:    now moved somewhere else
2021-05-17 12:22:31.004 Deanie chap:    I have removed some verification code that checks for the existence of the settings file, each time it treies to write
2021-05-17 09:58:59.990 Deanie chap:    making things quicker in operation
2021-05-17 09:58:48.081 Deanie chap:    They are probably saved up and then committed when the program exits
2021-05-17 09:58:24.696 Deanie chap:    which is when RD actually does save its changes
2021-05-17 09:58:09.222 Deanie chap:    they had a temporary structure that they could modify quickly in memory and only performed the saving changes when Rocketdock was exited
2021-05-17 09:57:22.517 Deanie chap:    or
2021-05-17 09:57:20.254 Deanie chap:    and so I suspect that either RD used multithreading to achieve the same thing with little discernible delay to the user
2021-05-17 09:33:34.052 Deanie chap:    c++ is multithreading
2021-05-17 09:33:07.468 Deanie chap:    it is only when they are added in sequence the delay is noticeable
2021-05-17 09:32:45.845 Deanie chap:    I have already optimised the add/delete operations so singly, they are acceptable
2021-05-17 09:32:22.300 Deanie chap:    but it is worth trying
2021-05-17 09:31:01.178 Deanie chap:    just move the delay another point
2021-05-17 09:30:47.627 Deanie chap:    I could add the tasks to a timer to operate in a semi-concurrent manner but it might not change anything
2021-05-17 09:29:08.780 Deanie chap:    nothing like it is supported in VB6 so I cannot run any tasks concurrently
2021-05-17 09:28:45.827 Deanie chap:    One of the limitations is a lack of multithreading

2021-05-17 08:40:57.055 Deanie chap:    The other strings in various places do not show at all, I assume that ids because they used an external resource file for strings
2021-05-17 08:40:04.903 Deanie chap:    so it has given me some pointers as to what to research next
2021-05-17 08:39:44.701 Deanie chap:    and another concerns rendering quality
2021-05-17 08:39:34.150 Deanie chap:    one I believe is a pointer to the code required to extract multiple icons from embedding inside DLLs and EXEs
2021-05-17 08:38:54.664 Deanie chap:    they use eight more that have functions that I am researching
2021-05-17 08:38:38.039 Deanie chap:    and they differ in only a few respects
2021-05-17 08:38:18.353 Deanie chap:    but I did find all the names of all the Windows APIs used in the program

2021-05-17 00:05:51.032 Deanie chap:    and the two routines together are a little slow
2021-05-17 00:05:20.255 Deanie chap:    then I am deleting the icon at the source
2021-05-17 00:05:06.323 Deanie chap:    I am adding a icon using the icon dragged using the usual add an icon element routine
2021-05-17 00:04:18.476 Deanie chap:    though it is a little slow
2021-05-17 00:04:10.642 Deanie chap:    drag and drop within the dock works
2021-05-16 23:45:49.884 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 23:45:24.842 Deanie chap:    it is just an advanced editor
2021-05-16 23:45:13.246 Deanie chap:    but I expect it is straightforward
2021-05-16 23:44:59.114 Deanie chap:    I haven't used it before
2021-05-16 23:44:52.551 Deanie chap:    vscode - same with me
2021-05-16 23:44:45.689 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 23:44:45.449 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 23:44:42.548 Deanie chap:    need to get my scanner working!
2021-05-16 23:44:34.601 Deanie chap:    and will be copying the underside
2021-05-16 23:44:18.540 Deanie chap:    I have found my flexi disc
2021-05-16 21:05:36.397 Deanie chap:    system hardly notices it is doing its stuff
2021-05-16 21:05:13.755 Deanie chap:    SD runs on my post powerful i7 system using between 1-4% of cpu during animation
2021-05-16 21:04:41.110 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 16:56:56.081 Deanie chap:    for the skills I have retaught myself
2021-05-16 16:56:47.470 Deanie chap:    but there is at least a future
2021-05-16 16:56:38.657 Deanie chap:    It will require a recode for certain
2021-05-16 16:56:28.731 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 16:56:26.411 Deanie chap:    I will have TwinBasic (no runtime)  RC5/6, Cairo and some adaptation to replace certain things that I used Win APIs to do.
2021-05-16 16:55:10.397 Deanie chap:    So, instead of VB6runtime, GDI+ and Win APIs
2021-05-16 16:54:23.345 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 16:54:21.795 Deanie chap:    that I never thought would be accessible
2021-05-16 16:54:10.916 Deanie chap:    but a future for my apps...
2021-05-16 16:53:59.045 Deanie chap:    and commercial for 64bits
2021-05-16 16:53:48.851 Deanie chap:    it will be 32bit initially
2021-05-16 16:53:42.780 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 16:53:41.650 Deanie chap:    and nears a production release
2021-05-16 16:53:30.929 Deanie chap:    TwinBasic will be for Windows only initially but as they abuilding it using C++ it will be adaptable to other oses as it grows
2021-05-16 16:52:41.580 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 16:52:41.220 Deanie chap:    and potentially Mac OS!
2021-05-16 16:52:31.419 Deanie chap:    then my dock will run on Windows and linux
2021-05-16 16:52:06.547 Deanie chap:    If I switch my dock to Cairo using some libraries known as RC5/6
2021-05-16 16:51:34.217 Deanie chap:    one fo the main graphics libraries used by VB6 is Cairo, the same as used in YWE
2021-05-16 16:51:05.411 Deanie chap:    and runs on multiple oses
2021-05-16 16:50:59.580 Deanie chap:    it is FOSS
2021-05-16 16:50:54.820 Deanie chap:    The replacement for VB6 used VScode as the IDE
2021-05-16 16:50:33.835 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 16:49:08.544 Deanie chap:    they are mousers
2021-05-16 16:49:01.579 Deanie chap:    luckily our cats are not interested in birds
2021-05-16 14:51:00.068 Deanie chap:    he sat sentry-like always facing her, silent and watching
2021-05-16 14:50:36.349 Deanie chap:    very impressed by the dedication of the father though
2021-05-16 14:49:47.667 Deanie chap:    so beautiful to watch though
2021-05-16 14:49:35.871 Deanie chap:    so sad
2021-05-16 14:49:33.394 Deanie chap:    yes
2021-05-16 14:45:47.060 Deanie chap:    probably not
2021-05-16 14:45:42.483 Deanie chap:    and whether she comes back to the nest?
2021-05-16 14:45:32.807 Deanie chap:    whether they guide them or not after that I do not know
2021-05-16 14:45:11.870 Deanie chap:    so, she seems to have survived and is perhaps now flying with her daddy somewhere learning the ropes
2021-05-16 14:44:39.666 Deanie chap:    then she was gone and he was gone too
2021-05-16 14:44:28.474 Deanie chap:    for approx. 30 mins
2021-05-16 14:44:20.824 Deanie chap:    with her daddy watching her the whole time
2021-05-16 14:44:00.869 Deanie chap:    then down to the ground on the other side to the road (quiet)
2021-05-16 14:43:43.611 Deanie chap:    then flew up to the top of 8ft wall
2021-05-16 14:43:30.101 Deanie chap:    Well, she flew from the tree and hopped a bit, about 20 ft from the tree
2021-05-16 12:04:16.433 Deanie chap:    lovely to see
2021-05-16 12:04:08.466 Deanie chap:    whilst its Father watched over it
2021-05-16 12:03:53.396 Deanie chap:    we just watched a new born blackbird fly for the first, second and third times
2021-05-16 12:03:24.181 Deanie chap:    sunny as anything though
2021-05-16 12:03:15.001 Deanie chap:     Sun May 16 2021 11:50:00 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time)

2021-05-16 12:03:15.009 Deanie chap:    
2021-05-16 12:02:52.120 Deanie chap:    wilco
2021-05-15 18:05:05.061 Deanie chap:    but it quite easy thus far
2021-05-15 18:04:55.493 Deanie chap:    now I need to remove the icon from whence it came
2021-05-15 18:04:37.095 Deanie chap:    it makes a copy of the icon dragged
2021-05-15 18:04:23.603 Deanie chap:    it drags, it drops and it deposits in the right place
2021-05-15 18:04:09.361 Deanie chap:    I have drag and drop from one position of the dock working 50%
2021-05-15 15:27:28.517 Deanie chap:
2021-05-15 15:27:27.220 Deanie chap:    it is just a matter of working through it all
2021-05-15 15:27:17.581 Deanie chap:    but I have my head around the concept and have done work in this area before so I am confident it can be done
2021-05-15 15:26:52.698 Deanie chap:    yet again a seemingly simple task that turns out to be a big bit of work
2021-05-15 15:26:34.389 Deanie chap:
2021-05-15 15:26:33.694 Deanie chap:    so I will have to see what I can build
2021-05-15 15:26:25.688 Deanie chap:    and there are different types of icons with differing methods of pulling the data in
2021-05-15 15:26:03.922 Deanie chap:    it seems that GDI has problems with preserving transparency
2021-05-15 15:25:46.004 Deanie chap:    some examples and some working code should halep me wade through the problem
2021-05-15 15:25:29.567 Deanie chap:
2021-05-15 15:25:27.885 Deanie chap:    and to take the icon data and extract it so that it is useful to GDI+ and can display on the dock
2021-05-15 15:25:04.366 Deanie chap:    but now I need to take it one step further
2021-05-15 15:24:55.598 Deanie chap:    I had this working well on the iconSettings tool
2021-05-15 15:24:37.986 Deanie chap:    I am working on extracting icons from embedding within DLLs and binaries
2021-05-15 15:24:14.999 Deanie chap:
2021-05-15 15:24:13.080 Deanie chap:    synch'd the clock on the laptop
2021-05-15 15:24:02.750 Deanie chap:
2021-05-15 15:23:56.591 Deanie chap:    just by itself
2021-05-15 15:23:49.629 Deanie chap:    too much maths for my brain to appreciate
2021-05-15 14:57:18.926 Deanie chap:    strange
2021-05-15 14:57:03.567 Deanie chap:    what's that?
2021-05-14 23:52:14.701 Deanie chap:    night night
2021-05-14 23:19:17.168 Deanie chap:    all look good?
2021-05-14 22:44:54.555 Deanie chap:    that should allow migration from 32bit VB6 and the old IDE to using VS Code and enable the creation of 64bit binaries
2021-05-14 22:43:54.241 Deanie chap:    this is a presentation of the new replacement for VB6
2021-05-14 22:43:23.207 Deanie chap:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBvMBAUSyT8&t=14s
2021-05-14 21:51:12.127 Deanie chap:    making progress?
2021-05-14 21:51:07.510 Deanie chap:    how was your day?
2021-05-14 21:51:02.832 Deanie chap:
2021-05-14 21:50:50.199 Deanie chap:    I have been disassembling the Rocketdock.exe using various tools to see what I can glean
2021-05-14 10:52:50.772 Deanie chap:    that made all those graphic transitions so easy
2021-05-14 10:52:38.893 Deanie chap:    a commerical library provided by someone else
2021-05-14 10:52:21.929 Deanie chap:    I feel sure that the chaps at Punk labs were using a library for GDI+ that allows them to create  GDI+ obects and methods for interacting with them
2021-05-14 10:51:28.305 Deanie chap:
2021-05-14 10:51:26.652 Deanie chap:    It is old-school non-object orientated programming
2021-05-14 10:50:59.065 Deanie chap:    and all new function 50% implemented with a clear method of how to achieve them
2021-05-14 10:50:32.599 Deanie chap:    so plenty in the pipeline
2021-05-14 10:50:14.716 Deanie chap:    and it is working
2021-05-14 10:50:02.515 Deanie chap:    I am working on making the transit into SD from the left/right ends much smoother
2021-05-14 10:49:30.413 Deanie chap:    Morning ! SD also now works in an identical fashion at the top of the screen re: white cog and other placement
2021-05-13 23:32:31.294 Deanie chap:    so it is clear where the dragged icon will appear on the dock
2021-05-13 23:32:07.495 Deanie chap:    and I have tarted up dragging to the dock too
2021-05-13 23:31:47.844 Deanie chap:    I have partially implemented dragging from one area of the dock to another
2021-05-13 23:30:59.166 Deanie chap:    when an icon is dragged from the dock it takes a copy of the icon with it at the cursor point
2021-05-13 23:30:28.063 Deanie chap:    that affected Rocketdock continuously
2021-05-13 23:30:08.800 Deanie chap:    but it has a modal pop up to prevent accidental deletions
2021-05-13 23:29:51.587 Deanie chap:    I have implemented drag from the dock in order to delete
2021-05-13 23:29:38.457 Deanie chap:    but it appears much more professional
2021-05-13 23:29:23.864 Deanie chap:    I will let you see the code when done and I'll take suggestions
2021-05-13 23:28:52.898 Deanie chap:    it is very smooth
2021-05-13 23:28:45.251 Deanie chap:    it is lovely but perhaps overkill
2021-05-13 23:28:33.490 Deanie chap:    I am using a easeINBounce twice, twice for a single icon click, one to rise the icon, the second call to drop it back down
2021-05-13 10:41:54.893 Deanie chap:    https://github.com/danro/jquery-easing/blob/master/jquery.easing.js
2021-05-13 10:41:36.719 Deanie chap:    looking at the maths
2021-05-13 10:41:31.939 Deanie chap:    I've been revisiting easing functions
2021-05-13 10:41:14.280 Deanie chap:    lots to clean...
2021-05-13 10:41:04.809 Deanie chap:    big problems in Mum's bedroom this morning
2021-05-12 17:08:25.880 Deanie chap:    looks professionally made
2021-05-12 16:18:01.892 Deanie chap:
2021-05-12 16:18:01.465 Deanie chap:
2021-05-12 16:18:00.037 Deanie chap:    show pictures when ready
2021-05-12 13:07:27.474 Deanie chap:    there is a mouseMove event that triggers and that combined with the mouseDown for the form as a whole can be used with a timer to determine if there is a drag to/from the dock
2021-05-12 13:06:14.136 Deanie chap:    it has to be done manually as I am not using objects
2021-05-12 13:05:58.233 Deanie chap:    on SD I am adding some code to identify a drag and drop event from the dock
2021-05-12 13:05:36.049 Deanie chap:
2021-05-12 13:04:54.099 Deanie chap:    it is a different world
2021-05-12 13:04:48.207 Deanie chap:    b
2021-05-12 13:04:43.310 Deanie chap:    I have been watching some C++ videos learning about the additional constructs available to them through licraries
2021-05-12 13:03:54.721 Deanie chap:
2021-05-12 09:18:43.375 Deanie chap:
2021-05-12 09:18:41.610 Deanie chap:    it makes me realise how good the Rocketdock chaps were though!
2021-05-12 09:18:29.565 Deanie chap:
2021-05-12 09:18:25.956 Deanie chap:    and slowly, surely, the functionality enters and improves.
2021-05-12 09:18:06.459 Deanie chap:    but it is the approach I  have to take
2021-05-12 09:17:56.107 Deanie chap:     the wrong way to design a product
2021-05-12 09:17:43.225 Deanie chap:    it is all about finding a solution, applying it quickly, then fixing all the problems afterwards
2021-05-12 09:17:12.520 Deanie chap:    so never time to really sit and think
2021-05-12 09:17:04.227 Deanie chap:    as disturbances/disuruptions appear from any direction
2021-05-12 09:16:42.411 Deanie chap:    r
2021-05-12 09:16:39.324 Deanie chap:    and never eally sitting down and really focussing
2021-05-12 09:16:23.598 Deanie chap:    and I'm learning as I go
2021-05-12 09:16:09.807 Deanie chap:    but I am doing on average probably no more than 30 mins per day
2021-05-12 09:15:53.265 Deanie chap:    it has taken me far longer than I expected
2021-05-12 09:15:41.822 Deanie chap:    You are quite right that I have done too much with it
2021-05-11 21:24:55.722 Deanie chap:    so, for the moment I will leave well alone
2021-05-11 21:24:38.318 Deanie chap:    it would look the same but requires some rejigging and then when the main form is moved, the 'child' forms will have to be moved in sync too
2021-05-11 21:23:39.974 Deanie chap:    At the moment I have six panels on the one form, the only workaround is to relocate those panels to separate forms, make those forms borderless and place the panels on them, fixing them in the same location as the panels
2021-05-11 21:21:43.057 Deanie chap:
2021-05-11 21:21:41.687 Deanie chap:    and said NO
2021-05-11 21:21:37.744 Deanie chap:    and the IDE baulked
2021-05-11 21:21:31.176 Deanie chap:    so I thought I'd a couple of controls plus labels
2021-05-11 21:21:11.424 Deanie chap:    and so I need a bounce height and possibly a speed
2021-05-11 21:20:38.562 Deanie chap:    my new bounce code needs a few controls to allow it to be tweaked
2021-05-11 21:20:17.955 Deanie chap:
2021-05-11 21:20:15.600 Deanie chap:    an unsurmountable limit
2021-05-11 21:20:08.207 Deanie chap:    A VB6 form can only have 255 controls
2021-05-11 21:19:50.011 Deanie chap:    I have reached a structural limit on the dock settings utility
2021-05-11 21:19:36.344 Deanie chap:
2021-05-11 19:42:07.911 Deanie chap:
2021-05-11 19:42:03.656 Deanie chap:    allows easier migration later
2021-05-11 19:41:50.283 Deanie chap:    so I just built them
2021-05-11 19:41:40.069 Deanie chap:    whereas .NET does
2021-05-11 19:41:30.826 Deanie chap:    it does not have those useful functions built in
2021-05-11 19:41:17.645 Deanie chap:    added padLeft padRight and Align functions to VB6
2021-05-11 19:40:57.861 Deanie chap:    some coding
2021-05-11 19:40:53.349 Deanie chap:    no rain here
2021-05-11 19:40:50.375 Deanie chap:
2021-05-11 17:30:45.612 Deanie chap:    rather than the kludge I had before
2021-05-11 17:30:30.252 Deanie chap:    when you click an icon
2021-05-11 17:30:16.990 Deanie chap:    on the coding front I have partially implemented easing out for the bounce
2021-05-11 16:29:03.564 Deanie chap:
2021-05-11 16:28:36.005 Deanie chap:    that I am avoiding
2021-05-11 16:28:31.310 Deanie chap:    there are lots of unpleasant tasks
2021-05-11 16:28:00.958 Deanie chap:    I'm sure you kinow how it is

2021-05-06 12:42:20.994 Deanie chap:
2021-05-06 12:42:12.822 Deanie chap:    soldered the wire and hotglued the switch as it was loose
2021-05-06 12:41:51.619 Deanie chap:    with emery paper
2021-05-06 12:41:44.660 Deanie chap:    and cleaned all the connectors
2021-05-06 12:41:28.968 Deanie chap:    I hot glued the speaker into the frame as the old sticky foam had degraded
2021-05-06 12:41:02.706 Deanie chap:    it had some flapping and displace battery connectors and a wire loose

2021-05-06 08:46:53.686 Deanie chap:    we always get it wrong
2021-05-06 08:46:44.877 Deanie chap:    so much from that time was either a pipedream or a bit of a fallacy as is all forward-looking
2021-05-06 08:46:09.251 Deanie chap:    and fascinating
2021-05-06 08:46:01.847 Deanie chap:    must have been fun

2021-05-05 11:51:00.582 Deanie chap:    I suppose it entails more than an MoT?
2021-05-05 11:50:40.457 Deanie chap:    That fee!
2021-05-05 11:50:22.069 Deanie chap:    which is now respected
2021-05-05 11:50:11.847 Deanie chap:    there is a setting for running "normal/minimised/maximised"

2021-05-05 09:41:21.007 Deanie chap:    doing anything interesting?
2021-05-04 19:06:27.481 Deanie chap:    is the filter failing?
2021-05-04 16:07:21.643 Deanie chap:    I meant the interior, dirty
2021-05-04 15:25:54.001 Deanie chap:    of phone/boats &c

2021-05-04 12:08:45.736 Deanie chap:    just a thought
2021-05-04 12:08:42.305 Deanie chap:    a useful tester in any case
2021-05-04 12:08:28.210 Deanie chap:    the YWE could fill that gap for the .js logic
2021-05-04 12:08:06.251 Deanie chap:    on some of the forums, a couple of chaps are bemoaning th e lack of a debugger for javascript coding
2021-05-04 12:07:37.245 Deanie chap:

2021-05-04 12:07:01.262 Deanie chap:    unsatifactory
2021-05-04 12:06:55.876 Deanie chap:
2021-05-04 12:06:53.063 Deanie chap:    at the moment the bike spends more time with the wheel off than on
2021-05-04 12:06:35.305 Deanie chap:
2021-05-04 12:06:18.420 Deanie chap:    they don't stick
2021-05-04 12:06:14.134 Deanie chap:    and the tapes too thin
2021-05-04 12:06:07.993 Deanie chap:    I need to find a way of armouring the tyres, there are tapes that sit between the tyre and the tube but my tyres are too fat
2021-05-04 12:05:17.912 Deanie chap:    but that should not be an issue on a bike
2021-05-04 12:05:08.163 Deanie chap:    I have used it on a car to mixed results, stopped the punctures but introduced vibration
2021-05-04 12:04:45.822 Deanie chap:    so I have bought some slime that goes into the tyre that should spread around the tyre and is supposed to seal holes as they appear
2021-05-04 12:03:34.888 Deanie chap:    so that the new armoured tubes aren't yet made for this size of tyre
2021-05-04 12:03:10.473 Deanie chap:    the tyres are 26 x 3 and that is a slightly strange size
2021-05-04 12:02:52.141 Deanie chap:    repairing my tyres again... puncture on the bike
2021-05-04 12:02:34.027 Deanie chap:

2021-05-04 12:02:19.384 Deanie chap:    affixing another of those discarnect devices to another car and one in the post for the the final car
2021-05-04 12:01:29.206 Deanie chap:    'orrid #ere
2021-05-03 22:28:31.608 Deanie chap:    weather is very grotty
2021-05-03 20:11:36.706 Deanie chap:    just peanuts now
2021-05-03 20:11:27.276 Deanie chap:    and they were once very expensive
2021-05-03 20:11:17.202 Deanie chap:    I already have one of those handheld temp gauges for humans
2021-05-03 20:11:00.014 Deanie chap:    and after that improved devices, not just a bolt together screen
2021-05-03 20:10:37.169 Deanie chap:    so I expect better at the price soon enough
2021-05-03 20:10:24.009 Deanie chap:    the thing abou those thermal imagers, when they hit the £50 price point they start to become affordable
2021-05-03 15:23:45.584 Deanie chap:    useful for finding heat spots in PCBs
2021-05-03 15:23:30.454 Deanie chap:    £50 thermal imagers
2021-05-03 15:23:17.278 Deanie chap:    https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/193758870673?_trkparms=aid%3D1110006%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.SIM%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20201210111314%26meid%3D3e36a05504a74be49a84014d24fb51e9%26pid%3D101195%26rk%3D4%26rkt%3D12%26mehot%3Dpf%26sd%3D293831524927%26itm%3D193758870673%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3DSimplAMLv9PairwiseUnbiasedWeb%26brand%3DUnbranded&_trksid=p2047675.c101195.m1851

2021-05-02 22:58:15.193 Deanie chap:
2021-05-02 22:57:55.042 Deanie chap:    we keep them in the drive behind a gate so alarm isn't an  issue
2021-05-02 22:57:34.740 Deanie chap:    so when they aren't used the battery is not drained
2021-05-02 22:57:19.457 Deanie chap:    my Dad's old car and Lucy's
2021-05-02 22:57:05.007 Deanie chap:    fitted a battery switch to two of our cars
2021-05-02 22:56:48.355 Deanie chap:
2021-05-02 16:47:24.698 Deanie chap:    hard to replicate

2021-05-01 22:42:18.168 Deanie chap:    improving the bounce
2021-05-01 22:42:07.877 Deanie chap:    sliding out
2021-05-01 22:42:01.153 Deanie chap:    four major things to change
2021-05-01 20:36:59.207 Deanie chap:    just rudimentary but it works
2021-05-01 20:36:38.859 Deanie chap:    also added deletion from the dock by dragging from the dock
2021-05-01 20:36:25.112 Deanie chap:    just some temporary animation to make it clear what is happening
2021-05-01 20:36:10.246 Deanie chap:    SD added some animation to drag and drop to the dock

2021-05-01 09:32:54.906 Deanie chap:    hair cuts - vital
