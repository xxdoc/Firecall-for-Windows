2021-08-06 10:41:55.530 Dean:    very good
2021-08-06 10:38:36.020 Dean:    a friend coming and I have to prepare
2021-08-06 10:38:27.850 Dean:    I masy be offline a lot today so forgive me
2021-08-06 10:37:32.790 Dean:    it is either internal (as previously encountered) or it is file creation thing from Dropbox
2021-08-06 10:37:03.580 Dean:    andstoring the value in a LONG would ever cause an overflow
2021-08-06 10:36:47.370 Dean:    but I want to find out why comparing a date now() with a fileDateTime
2021-08-06 10:36:24.890 Dean:    as that would give me even more of a range in secs and would avoid an overflow
2021-08-06 10:35:51.540 Dean:    I could simply change it to a DECIMAL
2021-08-06 10:35:35.830 Dean:    I am trying to imagine the situation that could cause a date/time range to exceed the 80 years a LONG gives me
2021-08-06 10:35:04.370 Dean:    then I add error checking and made the one irrelevant change and it stopped
2021-08-06 10:34:42.340 Dean:    it happened for several days on a trot
2021-08-06 10:34:25.970 Dean:    but only when an erroro occurs
2021-08-06 10:34:18.320 Dean:    it is totally covered in error traps and breakouts to print vars
2021-08-06 10:33:45.910 Dean:    hay fever worse this year than I remember it before
2021-08-06 10:33:31.680 Dean:    very poor night's sleep last night
2021-08-06 10:33:23.110 Dean:    
2021-08-06 10:33:09.800 Dean:    very strange
2021-08-06 10:32:45.490 Dean:    but not why
2021-08-06 10:32:34.520 Dean:    the error was quite clear as to exactly where it is situated and what the error type was
2021-08-06 10:32:00.920 Dean:    I do not like bugs that seem to go away...
2021-08-06 10:31:50.490 Dean:    I will keep the error handling in place and run for a while and see if the bug re-emerges
2021-08-06 10:31:28.150 Dean:    but I do not know why
2021-08-06 10:31:08.460 Dean:    srry about typos. laptop on lap at awkward angle
2021-08-06 10:30:51.120 Dean:    well, that's goo tha tit has gone
2021-08-06 10:30:37.900 Dean:    
2021-08-06 10:30:36.520 Dean:    so it should have no effect
2021-08-06 10:30:28.550 Dean:    but its scope is restricted to the other var
2021-08-06 10:30:12.680 Dean:    well, I made a single change to rename a duplicate var name in another function
2021-08-06 10:29:45.570 Dean:    not to prevent it
2021-08-06 10:29:40.230 Dean:    I have only made changes to catch the overflow error
2021-08-06 10:29:19.550 Dean:    Strange, no crash
2021-08-05 22:55:38.310 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2021-08-05 22:55:29.250 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2021-08-05 22:42:57.580 Dean:    small progress made with the large single listbox/chat window
2021-08-05 22:42:28.810 Dean:    so I am definitely inthe finishing zone
2021-08-05 22:42:12.660 Dean:    the other are all minor
2021-08-05 22:42:02.120 Dean:    one remaining
2021-08-05 22:41:57.640 Dean:    I have documented all the functions in two of my main code modules
2021-08-05 19:14:03.310 Dean:    I recommend a watch or two and suspend your opinions until you have given them a try
2021-08-05 19:13:25.470 Dean:    in almost all respects
2021-08-05 19:13:19.040 Dean:    as they are very true to the original
2021-08-05 19:13:08.090 Dean:    Still though, worth watching
2021-08-05 18:58:03.050 Dean:    if you liked the original, of course
2021-08-05 18:57:53.600 Dean:    Very similar to the original
2021-08-05 18:56:56.120 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G-ziTBAkbQ&t=32s
2021-08-05 18:56:55.270 Dean:    
2021-08-05 18:56:52.690 Dean:    on another subject
2021-08-05 18:56:43.090 Dean:    
2021-08-05 18:56:41.950 Dean:    It has been around for a long time
2021-08-05 18:56:03.940 Dean:    Do you have a thorough knowledge of AppleScript?
2021-08-05 15:36:06.750 Dean:    but nonetheless I decided to rename one var in one routine
2021-08-05 15:35:41.930 Dean:    so each should not affect the other
2021-08-05 15:35:31.790 Dean:    the two routines are encapsulated and do not share vars
2021-08-05 15:34:43.280 Dean:    to be be declared as an INT in another routine
2021-08-05 15:34:26.750 Dean:    timeDiffInSecs
2021-08-05 15:33:46.560 Dean:    I found the same var, 
2021-08-05 15:33:40.330 Dean:    with regard to my persistent LONG overload bug
2021-08-05 11:41:17.790 Dean:    manual translation?
2021-08-05 11:19:34.230 Dean:     Windspeed is 12 knots, force 4, direction SE
2021-08-05 11:19:34.090 Dean:     Partly cloudy at 3000 ft.
2021-08-05 11:19:33.910 Dean:     Humidity: 53 % 
2021-08-05 11:19:33.710 Dean:     Temperature: 22.00 C
2021-08-05 11:19:33.570 Dean:     Pressure: 1005 mb
2021-08-05 11:19:33.410 Dean:     EGSH NORWICH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM 
2021-08-05 11:19:33.220 Dean:     Thu Aug 05 2021 10:50:00 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time) 
2021-08-05 11:19:23.750 Dean:    very solid sleep last night, no hayfever
2021-08-05 11:18:43.530 Dean:    and see what it does
2021-08-05 11:18:37.150 Dean:    so I'll run it tonight compiled
2021-08-05 11:18:24.860 Dean:    met
2021-08-05 11:18:22.020 Dean:    none me, no messages
2021-08-05 11:18:11.020 Dean:    and extra error trapping and reporting if it met any of the conditions that might cause an error
2021-08-05 11:17:37.020 Dean:    I had a breakpoint set so catch it if it did
2021-08-05 11:17:21.310 Dean:    in the IDE...
2021-08-05 11:17:16.980 Dean:    well the error did nt occur last night
2021-08-04 22:30:28.530 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2021-08-04 22:30:26.270 Dean:    off to bed
2021-08-04 22:30:17.010 Dean:    she is just still young enough to do that
2021-08-04 22:30:06.410 Dean:    she still loves to come home and be our daughter
2021-08-04 22:29:48.550 Dean:    been cuddling up and chatting about life
2021-08-04 22:29:23.860 Dean:    daughter came home from uni.
2021-08-04 17:56:37.440 Dean:    and optimise the method
2021-08-04 17:56:23.630 Dean:    then I will see about merging it into the existing code
2021-08-04 17:55:19.300 Dean:    hoping not
2021-08-04 17:55:11.940 Dean:    and we'll see if that has a perceptible slow down
2021-08-04 17:54:49.590 Dean:    and I will simply transfer the data to the new array, sort and populate the new box
2021-08-04 17:54:30.650 Dean:    all the message filtering will remain where it is
2021-08-04 17:54:13.260 Dean:    and the code to populate it
2021-08-04 17:54:06.620 Dean:    a new array and listbox have been created
2021-08-04 17:53:52.160 Dean:    working on the code to create one bigger chat box
2021-08-04 15:51:01.220 Dean:    slow but sure
2021-08-04 15:28:50.180 Dean:    documented all functions - WIP fireCallMain 63%
2021-08-04 15:28:47.810 Dean:    
2021-08-04 14:16:56.640 Dean:    so no changes required
2021-08-04 14:16:49.780 Dean:    so I am just going to see how my code stand up tonight with err handlers
2021-08-04 14:16:30.410 Dean:    and how you described it was correct
2021-08-04 14:16:14.660 Dean:    I think we are OK
2021-08-04 14:16:09.820 Dean:    not looking in detail at the mo'
2021-08-04 14:15:38.640 Dean:    understood now
2021-08-04 14:11:06.350 Dean:    f
2021-08-04 14:11:04.990 Dean:    which should give enough seconds gor 80 years
2021-08-04 14:10:53.800 Dean:    as a long
2021-08-04 14:10:50.680 Dean:    and the var is declared correctly that stores the time diff in secs
2021-08-04 14:10:16.900 Dean:    both those functions are VB6 intrinsic functions
2021-08-04 14:10:00.610 Dean:    or the result of the dateDiff
2021-08-04 14:09:44.940 Dean:    the overflow is a result of a weird value form the getFileDateTime function
2021-08-04 14:09:14.510 Dean:    it is never assigned soem unknown value that causes it to revert to an integer
2021-08-04 14:08:51.480 Dean:    and it is valid again
2021-08-04 14:08:40.710 Dean:    it is valid and then it is recalculated
2021-08-04 14:08:17.650 Dean:    the timediff is never reset
2021-08-04 14:08:05.190 Dean:    very simple
2021-08-04 14:07:46.320 Dean:    it is set then stays that value until the next poll
2021-08-04 14:07:23.810 Dean:    never
2021-08-04 13:50:04.230 Dean:    thatit really confuses
2021-08-04 13:49:16.520 Dean:    but it is when the language or environment throws a wobbly
2021-08-04 13:48:58.520 Dean:    It should be easy enough
2021-08-04 13:48:49.950 Dean:    
2021-08-04 13:39:21.660 Dean:    if I cannot deal with it myself
2021-08-04 13:39:14.080 Dean:    if it happens again I will raise it on the VBforum
2021-08-04 13:38:54.520 Dean:    
2021-08-04 13:38:44.430 Dean:    and not the date/time stamp
2021-08-04 13:38:36.110 Dean:    previously it did not occur as I was checking the lineCount
2021-08-04 13:38:22.960 Dean:    and then make a decision
2021-08-04 13:38:11.860 Dean:    so that I can see what happens, if it occurs again in the IDE
2021-08-04 13:37:50.820 Dean:    I will run FCW in the IDE overnight, with various breakpoints set
2021-08-04 13:29:15.340 Dean:    I think you are right
2021-08-04 12:24:54.070 Dean:    Awake response. Request time: 2021-08-04 12:24:28.68
2021-08-04 12:24:53.390 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Microsoft Windows XP  Version:0.0.991
2021-08-04 11:50:54.040 Dean:    hmmm
2021-08-04 11:47:55.570 Dean:    what do you think?
2021-08-04 11:47:49.480 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:47:37.970 Dean:    it should be a file of some sort
2021-08-04 11:47:08.370 Dean:    and only attempt to read when the semaphore is clear
2021-08-04 11:46:49.610 Dean:    I should check for existence of that semaphore
2021-08-04 11:46:36.000 Dean:    i suppose we should really have a semaphore flag to indicate when you are recreating your output file
2021-08-04 11:45:56.880 Dean:    I am now testing for all such occurrences
2021-08-04 11:45:36.320 Dean:    or var being forced to an integer (which I have encountered before with a workaround)
2021-08-04 11:45:06.080 Dean:    so it is either one date being null or malformed
2021-08-04 11:44:53.730 Dean:    an overflow is typically caused by the result exceedign the max
2021-08-04 11:44:17.320 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:44:04.790 Dean:    both of which will cause the routine to exit
2021-08-04 11:43:45.560 Dean:    If IsNull(fileModificationTime) Then Exit Sub
2021-08-04 11:43:27.290 Dean:    I am also checking for a nulldate
2021-08-04 11:43:16.640 Dean:    possible occasions whenthe file is being recreated
2021-08-04 11:43:02.330 Dean:    but it will catch more
2021-08-04 11:42:53.970 Dean:    not perfect 
2021-08-04 11:42:44.680 Dean:    before it extracts the fileModificationTime
2021-08-04 11:42:25.050 Dean:    for the moment I have added a line previous that checks for the files existence
2021-08-04 11:41:57.710 Dean:    I could do the maths myself but when there is a VB6 function it is wise to use the known function
2021-08-04 11:41:28.620 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:33:09.290 Dean:    hmmm
2021-08-04 11:19:49.280 Dean:    I will add a check for that
2021-08-04 11:19:40.940 Dean:    possibly
2021-08-04 11:19:37.510 Dean:    and so the file modification date is zero?
2021-08-04 11:19:22.110 Dean:    Ah, could it be that the input file is being file is being recreated at that time?
2021-08-04 11:17:55.160 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:17:54.360 Dean:    I may have to do a workaround avoiding datediff
2021-08-04 11:17:34.890 Dean:    I am sure that is it, having encountered somethign like it before
2021-08-04 11:17:19.280 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:17:07.740 Dean:    it is as if the internal comparison of the two dates is forcing an internal value to an integer
2021-08-04 11:16:38.220 Dean:    as it shows valid dates at the point of failure
2021-08-04 11:15:58.960 Dean:    error checking has proven this
2021-08-04 11:15:52.810 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:15:42.050 Dean:    as if the timeDiffInSecs has somehow reverted to a integer holding values <32768
2021-08-04 11:14:57.460 Dean:    an
2021-08-04 11:14:56.070 Dean:    it generates and overflow error
2021-08-04 11:14:46.200 Dean:    but if I leave it longer than 9hrs
2021-08-04 11:14:33.180 Dean:    every 15 secs
2021-08-04 11:14:26.500 Dean:    that works all the time
2021-08-04 11:14:21.790 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:14:20.390 Dean:        End If
2021-08-04 11:14:20.220 Dean:            Exit Sub  
2021-08-04 11:14:20.060 Dean:        If timeDiffInSecs = 0 Then
2021-08-04 11:14:18.540 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:14:17.990 Dean:    then if there is no difference simply exit
2021-08-04 11:14:08.930 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:13:57.980 Dean:        timeDiffInSecs = DateDiff("s", oldFileModificationTime, fileModificationTime)
2021-08-04 11:13:57.820 Dean:    fileModificationTime = FileDateTime(FCWSharedInputFile)
2021-08-04 11:13:56.370 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:13:55.690 Dean:    I do a file datetime check and compare it to the stored old time
2021-08-04 11:13:31.520 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:13:19.200 Dean:    that ought to give a max 86 years as a LONG in secs
2021-08-04 11:13:01.010 Dean:    Dim timeDiffInSecs As Long
2021-08-04 11:12:59.600 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:12:59.030 Dean:    the var in question is defined as a LONG
2021-08-04 11:12:42.350 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:12:40.800 Dean:    Public oldFileModificationTime As Date
2021-08-04 11:12:40.610 Dean:    Public fileModificationTime As Date
2021-08-04 11:12:39.100 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:12:38.360 Dean:    the two dates are defined as DATE types
2021-08-04 11:12:18.210 Dean:    when comparing dates
2021-08-04 11:12:11.860 Dean:    it is an overflow of a long integer
2021-08-04 11:11:58.950 Dean:    I have a bug that I cannot fathom
2021-08-04 11:11:51.590 Dean:    
2021-08-04 11:11:41.250 Dean:    quite relieved
2021-08-04 11:11:34.070 Dean:    thought it was one of my changes
2021-08-04 11:11:07.110 Dean:    you have done a re-org. of the exchange folder

2021-08-03 12:02:44.240 Dean:    Are you alright?
2021-08-03 11:33:46.950 Dean:    agreed
2021-08-03 11:00:12.960 Dean:    using POP3\IMAP and SMTP to achieve the things you want
2021-08-03 10:59:57.480 Dean:    generally people say avoid outlook and do what VBsendmail does
2021-08-03 10:58:44.230 Dean:    https://www.google.com/search?q=outlook+CLSID&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
2021-08-03 10:58:42.400 Dean:    nope
2021-08-03 10:57:32.180 Dean:    and emulate the YWE version of the clock
2021-08-03 10:57:23.390 Dean:    and then I can add graphical hands
2021-08-03 10:57:03.530 Dean:    I now need find examples of rotating images around a specific point
2021-08-03 10:56:32.850 Dean:    the clock I have found simply draws lines for the hands much in the same way we are currently doing
2021-08-03 10:55:45.640 Dean:    quite a lot
2021-08-03 10:55:39.610 Dean:    the main difference is the amount of GDI+ API declarations
2021-08-03 10:55:13.650 Dean:     it is very similar to what I am doing in VB6 code 
2021-08-03 10:54:57.080 Dean:    I have the code to bring a GDI+ clock into FCW
2021-08-03 10:53:57.570 Dean:    very good
2021-08-03 10:32:54.550 Dean:    that is the VB6 versions of sendmail
2021-08-03 10:32:38.330 Dean:    <><>vbsendmail(1).zip
2021-08-03 10:27:27.470 Dean:    so, I have added some error trapping around it
2021-08-03 10:27:12.360 Dean:    but when left to do its thing it can fail after a system wake up
2021-08-03 10:26:50.800 Dean:    works well
2021-08-03 10:26:46.470 Dean:    fromt he file
2021-08-03 10:26:43.140 Dean:    and if the value is zero it extracts the data
2021-08-03 10:26:22.880 Dean:    I am mereley doing a dateDiff, assigning the value to a LONG
2021-08-03 10:26:00.690 Dean:    then it falls over with an overflow
2021-08-03 10:25:53.190 Dean:    but it keeps showing the lamp repeatedly as if the file has been modified
2021-08-03 10:25:23.520 Dean:    so it should give me 86 years of time boundary
2021-08-03 10:25:01.710 Dean:    is a LONG
2021-08-03 10:24:57.260 Dean:    the timediffinSecs
2021-08-03 10:24:47.060 Dean:    I have been receiving an occasional overflow err when leaving FCW running and waking the system from a sleep

2021-08-03 10:24:05.450 Dean:    tiny
2021-08-03 10:24:00.850 Dean:    and the o/s provided a tine version
2021-08-03 10:23:40.130 Dean:    outlook was the default app for email once upon a time
2021-08-03 10:22:41.590 Dean:    I have not even tested it yet
2021-08-03 10:22:35.260 Dean:    and was not expecting to have to until it failed
2021-08-03 10:22:19.460 Dean:    I have not looked into it in any detail
2021-08-03 10:22:08.800 Dean:    I could send you the VB6 zip if you wanted but it may be of limited use
2021-08-03 10:21:47.770 Dean:    I am sure the same exists for .js if it exists for VB6
2021-08-03 10:21:11.990 Dean:    instead  using the pop/SMTP values and sending its own email without using any email client
2021-08-03 10:20:34.470 Dean:    that does not assume an email client
2021-08-03 10:20:18.370 Dean:    I have a vbsendmail
2021-08-03 10:20:00.500 Dean:    assuming that everyone has outlook is a mistake
2021-08-03 10:19:48.270 Dean:    I found various solution in VB6 that looked for the same object
2021-08-03 10:19:24.820 Dean:    it is not intrinsically installed these days
2021-08-03 10:19:11.970 Dean:    If you do not have outlook installed then it will have a problem

2021-07-28 17:32:41.270 Dean:    CPU in general still <10%
2021-07-28 17:32:28.460 Dean:    though it was barely noticeable
2021-07-28 17:32:20.770 Dean:    so there will be an overhead
2021-07-28 17:32:13.600 Dean:    so the whole file has to be read

2021-07-28 14:29:40.830 Dean:    very sensible
2021-07-28 14:26:42.130 Dean:    I try to get my kids to do so
2021-07-28 14:26:34.250 Dean:    do you always shutdown puters when the lighting is near?
2021-07-28 14:26:19.460 Dean:    one at night that woke me up
2021-07-28 14:26:09.630 Dean:    we had thunderstorms recently but none approached too close
2021-07-28 14:23:33.580 Dean:    lovely voice
2021-07-28 14:20:33.640 Dean:    or was that you?
2021-07-28 14:20:30.060 Dean:    was text to speech?
2021-07-28 14:20:10.680 Dean:    that m4a?
2021-07-28 14:00:24.840 Dean:    not a request for more functionality
2021-07-28 14:00:12.930 Dean:    so just a question
2021-07-28 14:00:06.990 Dean:    and Vb6 won't know about it
2021-07-28 13:59:58.180 Dean:    and this is an eare that is likely to change/instability in Windows
2021-07-28 13:59:27.760 Dean:    the default voice is poor
2021-07-28 13:59:21.750 Dean:    yes, it was awful on Win7 certainly
2021-07-28 13:37:09.160 Dean:    all working well
2021-07-28 13:31:08.930 Dean:    I should check the date
2021-07-28 13:30:56.500 Dean:    that caused the linecount to be different and thus the lamp lit
2021-07-28 13:30:41.760 Dean:    I should imagine it was deleting a line
2021-07-28 13:30:31.910 Dean:    no conflict, just a linecount discrepancy
2021-07-28 13:30:21.930 Dean:    
2021-07-28 13:29:41.130 Dean:    send me a squarish image please

2021-07-28 12:59:07.560 Dean:    
2021-07-28 12:56:33.040 Dean:    perhaps twice
2021-07-28 12:56:28.460 Dean:    it happens very infrequently
2021-07-28 12:56:18.250 Dean:    and it was the other day
2021-07-28 12:56:13.840 Dean:    it was yours that I was thinking about
2021-07-28 12:55:36.890 Dean:    as I could not quite understand why it occurred, the logic is so simple
2021-07-28 12:55:10.830 Dean:    then I will have the 'bug' in the bag
2021-07-28 12:54:59.790 Dean:    if you woule be so kind as to let me know when you make a manual edit that might change linecount
2021-07-28 12:54:21.810 Dean:    so a date check will do
2021-07-28 12:54:10.950 Dean:    All I want to do is raise a lamp
2021-07-28 12:53:57.070 Dean:    
2021-07-28 12:53:54.900 Dean:    but not now
2021-07-28 12:53:50.160 Dean:    Could be useful later if we wanted overall encryption
2021-07-28 12:53:14.980 Dean:    checksum is overkill
2021-07-28 12:52:59.390 Dean:    but both will still result in a lamp change if you edit manually I suppose
2021-07-28 12:52:36.660 Dean:    I may supplement it or change it
2021-07-28 12:52:26.660 Dean:    but probably not as quick as a date check
2021-07-28 12:52:12.770 Dean:    A line count is quick to perform, occurring in ms
2021-07-28 12:51:43.540 Dean:    Well, that is probably quicker too
2021-07-28 12:51:15.500 Dean:    as I can see no other reason why the linecounts would be different between two polls but the latest text seemed the same
2021-07-28 12:50:29.650 Dean:    I have to assume that you had edited your file manually resulting in a change to the linecount
2021-07-28 12:49:57.220 Dean:    well, I could see no text changes to your side
2021-07-28 12:49:39.340 Dean:    with no apparent textual changes to the input file
2021-07-28 12:49:30.340 Dean:    reason that I ask is the code to raise the green lamp has on rare occasions got that far
2021-07-28 12:48:18.950 Dean:    
2021-07-28 12:44:24.570 Dean:    but the linecount seemed sufficient
2021-07-28 12:44:10.010 Dean:    I could check file modification date/time
2021-07-28 12:43:41.740 Dean:    and if the two don't match I re-read the file into the array and into the listbx
2021-07-28 12:43:18.020 Dean:    I store the old linecount from the previous poll
2021-07-28 12:42:58.150 Dean:    as a simple check assuming that any change to a file should always be to add a line
2021-07-28 12:42:31.560 Dean:    in FCW I do a lineCount
2021-07-28 12:42:09.680 Dean:    in FC what check do you perform to see if the input file has been changed?
2021-07-28 12:41:44.220 Dean:    q. for you
2021-07-28 12:40:39.310 Dean:    of doing it correctly
2021-07-28 12:40:33.680 Dean:    and this is one step on the path
2021-07-28 12:40:12.340 Dean:    given what I know already
2021-07-28 12:40:01.710 Dean:    I feel a conversion to .NET is achievable with this utility
2021-07-28 12:39:33.730 Dean:    setting them
2021-07-28 12:39:26.920 Dean:    but I am trying to go through my passed vars and intelligently
2021-07-28 12:39:06.460 Dean:    and I could simply add byRef to each as a kludge
2021-07-28 12:38:38.090 Dean:    VB6 makes a ssumptions
2021-07-28 12:38:28.980 Dean:    changing all my routines to contain byRef or ByVal qualifiers
2021-07-28 12:36:01.240 Dean:    the best but wit a few known problems
2021-07-28 12:35:48.910 Dean:    old version of photoshop
2021-07-28 12:35:41.250 Dean:    just removes chars from the end of filenames without warning you
2021-07-28 12:35:18.150 Dean:    it does that
2021-07-28 12:35:14.880 Dean:    it is probably truncating due to a photoshop issue
2021-07-28 09:28:57.540 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2021-07-27 23:30:19.545 Dean:    Ta Ta For Now!

2021-07-27 22:24:57.050 Dean:    but now done
2021-07-27 22:24:53.190 Dean:    and add an event capture for each
2021-07-27 22:24:42.550 Dean:    a bit of a pain to have to go through each one
2021-07-27 22:24:29.740 Dean:    but controls do not click through
2021-07-27 22:24:18.670 Dean:    you add it to the underlying form
2021-07-27 22:24:04.590 Dean:    and if you don't enable it for each, it will not appear
2021-07-27 22:23:48.320 Dean:    the menu is generated on a per control basis
2021-07-27 22:23:35.760 Dean:    to all controls
2021-07-27 22:23:28.310 Dean:    I have been tinkering with FCW adding right click-ability

2021-07-26 23:27:11.586 Dean:    and end up with an empty file with only the awake response
2021-07-26 23:26:52.291 Dean:    sending a message would cancel the process 
2021-07-26 23:26:35.066 Dean:    as I am analysing the notifications as I am creating the arrays and populating the listboxes
2021-07-26 23:25:57.967 Dean:    
2021-07-26 23:25:55.008 Dean:    e
2021-07-26 23:25:53.555 Dean:    that should be asy enough to do
2021-07-26 23:25:34.611 Dean:    righto
2021-07-26 23:25:13.686 Dean:    for reasons of design
2021-07-26 23:25:06.236 Dean:    it was a little more complex than I wanted it to be
2021-07-26 23:24:53.571 Dean:    The logic seems to be working correctly
2021-07-26 23:22:47.269 Dean:    Awake response. Request time: Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:22:47 +0100 GDT
2021-07-26 23:22:20.422 Dean:    small bug to fix

2021-07-26 19:07:06.130 Dean:    and when shut in the normal fashion
2021-07-26 19:06:52.120 Dean:    perhaps when the emoji panel is open, you show images there
2021-07-26 18:40:50.710 Dean:    I use the same code to display images and icons so it also seemed natural to do them all in the same way
2021-07-26 18:36:54.250 Dean:    I just found convenient and forms without borders are tricky bu@@ers in VB6
2021-07-26 18:36:19.340 Dean:    but I can understand why you don't  want to in FC
2021-07-26 18:36:03.370 Dean:    on FCW I use the same picbox to display images and icons as it makes it much easier in form creation and handling
2021-07-26 16:42:41.650 Dean:    note so many rocky outcrops

2021-07-26 16:06:52.430 Dean:    and I fixed it by restoring a recent backup
2021-07-26 16:06:35.670 Dean:    it happened twice today
2021-07-26 16:06:16.740 Dean:    recent text
2021-07-26 16:05:54.310 Dean:    preventing a clear down of the data containing only my own text
2021-07-26 16:05:20.430 Dean:    
2021-07-26 16:05:15.810 Dean:    and it prevents a run of the polling logic whilst I am adding a text
2021-07-26 16:04:46.750 Dean:    it is now embedded within the central logic
2021-07-26 16:04:33.290 Dean:    the flag was set in a place not called by both methods
2021-07-26 16:04:16.900 Dean:    the other a timer in code
2021-07-26 16:04:07.990 Dean:    one a Vb6 timer <=65,536
2021-07-26 16:03:51.730 Dean:    that is due to having two methods of initiating the timer
2021-07-26 16:03:37.320 Dean:    my mechanism for disabling the polling timer logic when a text was being sent was faulty
2021-07-26 16:03:05.140 Dean:    it was synchronisation with the polling timer
2021-07-26 16:02:51.210 Dean:    but it was not the issue
2021-07-26 16:02:44.840 Dean:    and I thought I had found the problem

2021-07-26 16:00:55.190 Dean:    I just found a serious bug
2021-07-26 16:00:47.590 Dean:    testing
2021-07-26 15:46:53.850 Dean:    they tend to go "wow" and say "that's with VB6?"
2021-07-26 15:46:34.200 Dean:    but when faced with a good-looking app
2021-07-26 15:46:21.570 Dean:    otherwise they can be very judgemental
2021-07-26 15:46:06.460 Dean:    and when it comes to a Vb6 app. you need to make it look impressive 
2021-07-26 15:45:41.950 Dean:    not the content
2021-07-26 15:45:35.480 Dean:    d
2021-07-26 15:45:33.320 Dean:    and they jusge according to the flimflam
2021-07-26 15:45:23.760 Dean:    but people like it
2021-07-26 15:45:16.640 Dean:    the icons are the flimflam
2021-07-26 13:42:46.090 Dean:    but my flatfile DB works across the board on any platform, version of VB6
2021-07-26 13:42:19.230 Dean:    using an off the shelf  db would assist my knowledge in DBs and interfacing to Vb6
2021-07-26 13:41:41.530 Dean:    
2021-07-26 13:41:38.870 Dean:    or convert it to SQLite
2021-07-26 13:41:30.620 Dean:    I was mulling whether I continue to use my own flat file DB "crapInABag"
2021-07-26 13:40:49.960 Dean:    and how I will bring it forward
2021-07-26 13:40:39.080 Dean:    thinking about my old Firestrike tool

2021-07-25 14:55:01.370 Dean:    something no VB6-er ever does
2021-07-25 14:54:49.720 Dean:    
2021-07-25 14:54:47.650 Dean:    so one task will be to work my way through all routines and ensure they vars are explicitly stated
2021-07-25 14:54:18.820 Dean:    and a lot of work to identify variables and passing of values
2021-07-25 14:53:58.590 Dean:    Every routine now acts potentially very differently
2021-07-25 14:53:55.740 Dean:    in NET I think there is (unsure) but it is safe to always do so
2021-07-25 14:53:32.250 Dean:    In Vb6 there is no need to specify which
2021-07-25 14:52:55.740 Dean:    whereas in .NET the default is byVal
2021-07-25 14:52:37.410 Dean:    but byRef is the default
2021-07-25 14:52:30.050 Dean:    ypu can explicitly state byRef or byVal
2021-07-25 14:52:18.120 Dean:    so that a change to the variable may have consequences outside the subroutine
2021-07-25 14:51:26.460 Dean:    sorry by Ref
2021-07-25 14:51:18.150 Dean:    in a VB6 function or subroutine all the vars passed are byVal

2021-07-22 20:25:14.440 Dean:    It had previously annoyed me that my images were occasionally overwritten when testing the viewing of Tiffs &c
2021-07-22 20:24:34.770 Dean:    e
2021-07-22 20:24:31.810 Dean:    it won't show your new image until my last view of th other image is 180 secs old
2021-07-22 20:23:44.480 Dean:    but iif I have recently selected an alternate image for viewing
2021-07-22 20:23:11.800 Dean:    I want it to do that as I always want to see a new image you send as priority
2021-07-22 20:22:43.560 Dean:    then it overwrites my chosen image with the latest one you sent
2021-07-22 20:22:26.450 Dean:    if I am viewing another image and the n seconds arrives
2021-07-22 20:22:11.580 Dean:    and it does that every n seconds
2021-07-22 20:21:59.220 Dean:    FCW always displays the latest image you send
2021-07-22 19:50:02.880 Dean:    to get them just right

2021-07-22 19:33:59.660 Dean:    the VB6 version looks alright
2021-07-22 19:33:31.630 Dean:    the  FC clock looks so much better than the FCW version

2021-07-21 17:13:37.240 Dean:    One thing .js is missing is another (!) timer to test for the output file modification if another FC is running locally to keep them both in synch
2021-07-21 17:12:24.980 Dean:    using both simultaneously

2021-07-21 14:42:46.890 Dean:    The image resizing proportionally all seems to be working, only one case causing a problem
2021-07-21 13:44:37.820 Dean:    but only at widget start
2021-07-21 13:44:25.980 Dean:    sounds like there is something similar being done in the YWE
2021-07-21 13:43:59.160 Dean:    or the image can be blurry
2021-07-21 13:43:43.130 Dean:    on VB6 we have to take the DPI into account when rendering an image or text
2021-07-21 13:43:11.670 Dean:    per screen
2021-07-21 13:43:08.590 Dean:    DPI
2021-07-21 12:15:16.710 Dean:    as I have different methods fo rendering images to the picbox the nomal methods do not always apply
2021-07-21 12:14:51.700 Dean:    need to do the same for some native image types too I have found as my code does not always function as it should
2021-07-21 12:14:00.520 Dean:    fixed the proportional resizing of incoming images of all 'foreign' image types
2021-07-21 12:08:21.870 Dean:    righto
2021-07-21 10:58:15.800 Dean:    in progress
2021-07-21 10:58:11.450 Dean:    when displayed
2021-07-21 10:58:07.390 Dean:    then I can proportion the image
2021-07-21 10:57:33.970 Dean:    so I am digging intot he code to see how and when the original sizing is captured, then I can create a couple of vars to expose the sizing, so I can discover the original image proportions
2021-07-21 10:56:24.680 Dean:    the code that converts from foreign to native BMP is a self contained class that does not expose the original image properties in a public way
2021-07-21 10:55:33.730 Dean:    square I mean
2021-07-21 10:55:23.520 Dean:    but the image sent look strange squished to icon size
2021-07-21 10:54:58.660 Dean:    suitable for icons
2021-07-21 10:54:54.350 Dean:    the old code was taken from the SD icon tool and enforces a square aspect ratio
2021-07-21 10:54:21.870 Dean:    I am working on FCW to improve the proportional display of images in the picturebox
2021-07-21 10:53:54.220 Dean:    understood
2021-07-21 10:28:36.840 Dean:    I'll do the help image
2021-07-21 10:28:11.620 Dean:    presumably on osx?
2021-07-21 10:28:01.430 Dean:    the numbers of both in the windows are offset due to a font selection issue?
2021-07-21 10:27:30.950 Dean:    as expected

2021-07-20 20:53:38.770 Dean:    I find late government in fighting unpleasant
2021-07-20 20:53:24.270 Dean:    I will not watch the Cummings interview
2021-07-20 20:53:05.340 Dean:    
2021-07-20 20:52:59.050 Dean:    sometimes it all seems like that
2021-07-20 20:52:45.730 Dean:    the latter really worth watching
2021-07-20 20:52:35.730 Dean:    or watch the BBC TV dramatisation?
2021-07-20 20:52:23.050 Dean:    Did you ever read Bleak House?
2021-07-20 20:52:14.300 Dean:    but poorer people might have gone under
2021-07-20 20:51:59.450 Dean:    we have plunged our hands deep into our pockets but we are surviving
2021-07-20 20:51:34.200 Dean:    and quite right, if you were really poor, how would you survive?
2021-07-20 20:51:06.950 Dean:    the former took four and a half months
2021-07-20 20:41:48.600 Dean:    the latter took three months
2021-07-20 20:41:36.050 Dean:    we have the Court Order of protection for my Mum and we now have a bank account for her
2021-07-20 20:41:10.830 Dean:    we have had some good news at this end
2021-07-20 20:41:02.670 Dean:    
2021-07-20 20:40:56.680 Dean:    and if I make progress in one way it is enough
2021-07-20 20:40:39.820 Dean:    all counts as a bug in my mind
2021-07-20 20:40:29.290 Dean:    bug/fix/document/think
2021-07-20 20:40:07.610 Dean:    but I reassure myself with the thought of one bug per day is at least steady progress
2021-07-20 20:39:42.910 Dean:    I am always aware that my progrss is slow
2021-07-20 20:39:27.830 Dean:    I know
2021-07-20 20:39:15.660 Dean:    
2021-07-20 20:38:30.630 Dean:    understood
2021-07-20 20:38:14.090 Dean:    and I'll see if my brain is working enough
2021-07-20 20:38:03.720 Dean:    then a few household chores
2021-07-20 20:37:55.260 Dean:    about to put Mum to bed
2021-07-20 20:37:46.800 Dean:    step by step I am afraid
2021-07-20 20:37:31.970 Dean:    one of the next tasks

2021-07-20 20:36:59.160 Dean:    too busy complicating things
2021-07-20 20:36:37.350 Dean:    I do not remember creating a version with out the stopwatch function
2021-07-20 20:34:39.620 Dean:    Just realised we probably don't have a real YWE version of a Pz clock without all the stopwatch bells and whistles
2021-07-20 20:33:40.860 Dean:    it enlivens the UI and gives the impression of an active tool
2021-07-20 20:33:12.380 Dean:    I do like the Pz clock being present
2021-07-20 20:32:46.600 Dean:    ensuring the rest follows the same rules
2021-07-20 20:32:34.730 Dean:    your spec really helped

2021-07-20 11:13:23.000 Dean:    It seems to work as expected
2021-07-20 11:03:14.000 Dean:    so now it should store the hiding process and check whether it is still running or not before coming back
2021-07-20 11:02:23.000 Dean:    and if you are running full screen then it can interfere with that full screen app
2021-07-20 11:02:01.000 Dean:    at the moment it comes back after two hours (my set hiding time) automatically
2021-07-20 11:01:25.000 Dean:    so that it checks to see if the hiding process is still running before bringing SD back again
2021-07-20 11:00:54.000 Dean:    SD - I am modifying one of the timers that causes SD to re-appear after being hidden automatically

2021-07-17 20:23:58.000 Dean:    have a look at the stamps

2021-07-17 20:23:08.000 Dean:    I like being able to connect the last buzz with the timestamp
2021-07-17 20:22:43.000 Dean:    the lamp is sufficient
2021-07-17 20:22:35.000 Dean:    re: repeat buzzer behaviour I agree and have thought about implementing a timer to repeat but once is enough for now
2021-07-17 20:22:05.000 Dean:    
2021-07-17 20:21:55.000 Dean:    we have been able to have windows any shape we want for the last 15 years or more
2021-07-17 20:21:33.000 Dean:    Windows is now sporting rounded corners onthe Windows as a significant feature
2021-07-17 20:21:00.000 Dean:    but they were so wedded to fixed type controls
2021-07-17 20:20:40.000 Dean:    should have been an obvious option
2021-07-17 20:20:23.000 Dean:    the idea of a flexible image layer that can be anything
2021-07-17 20:20:03.000 Dean:    I never understood why the concept of controls shuld be so rigid in other MS type languages
2021-07-17 20:19:16.000 Dean:    YWE is no longer on Yahoo's product list
2021-07-17 20:18:44.000 Dean:    IS it worth asking?
2021-07-17 20:18:40.000 Dean:    Mr. Rice, does he still work at Yahoo?
2021-07-17 20:18:11.000 Dean:    and just recreate the Xwidget designer with improvements
2021-07-17 20:17:41.000 Dean:    probably use visual studio code as the editor
2021-07-17 20:17:05.000 Dean:    as it would be worth the time
2021-07-17 20:16:56.000 Dean:    if it was available FOSS I would fix the system volume facility and start that IDE
2021-07-17 20:16:28.000 Dean:    and FOSS
2021-07-17 20:16:17.000 Dean:    It only lacks an IDE and a more integrated debugger
2021-07-17 20:15:54.000 Dean:    I never fail to appreciate how good YWE was and is
2021-07-17 20:12:02.000 Dean:    at the lower level
2021-07-17 20:11:49.000 Dean:    That may well be what the YWE does
2021-07-17 20:11:29.000 Dean:    we'll see how it goes
2021-07-17 20:11:22.000 Dean:    but I may have to redraw the whole clock
2021-07-17 20:11:08.000 Dean:    I am sure it is possible
2021-07-17 20:10:57.000 Dean:    and if I succeed it may be able to replicate what YWE has by default, layered images
2021-07-17 20:10:30.000 Dean:    I will attempt a GDI clock
2021-07-17 20:10:21.000 Dean:    all those little touches add up to a finished look and feel
2021-07-17 20:10:03.000 Dean:    agreed
2021-07-17 18:39:20.000 Dean:    So much to do at the moment, hard to find time for anything else.
2021-07-17 18:39:16.000 Dean:    Coding continues apace, step by step it progresses.

2021-07-17 17:08:06.000 Dean:    and only buzzes again once when a new buzz is receieved (as it just did)
2021-07-17 17:07:34.000 Dean:    it stores the timestamp
2021-07-17 17:07:05.000 Dean:    it checks that the last thing it received is a buzzer and acts upon that
2021-07-17 17:06:47.000 Dean:    if you send two or three then I think my code only plays the very last one
2021-07-17 17:06:27.000 Dean:    yes and that
2021-07-17 17:06:01.000 Dean:    I was here for that one
2021-07-17 17:05:36.000 Dean:    I am always doing something else
2021-07-17 17:04:50.000 Dean:    the light is on though
2021-07-17 17:04:42.000 Dean:    I never hear them
2021-07-17 17:04:34.000 Dean:    I keep missing your buzzer requests
2021-07-17 16:25:41.000 Dean:    so no second buzzing on a restart
2021-07-17 16:25:30.000 Dean:    so it now saves it and reads it on restart
2021-07-17 16:25:19.000 Dean:    the last buzz time is lost on a restart though
2021-07-17 16:24:59.000 Dean:    which it compares to, to see if it has already buzzed it
2021-07-17 16:24:40.000 Dean:    I am saving the timestamp of the last buzz
2021-07-17 16:24:30.000 Dean:    when you can
2021-07-17 16:24:26.000 Dean:    send me a buzz pls

2021-07-17 14:13:12.000 Dean:    the buzz came when I was in the kitchen but the lamp informs me of it.

2021-07-17 10:34:33.000 Dean:    see the panzer widgets on your desktop for the subtle method
2021-07-17 10:34:10.000 Dean:    experiment with opacity until it achieves what you want without really being noticeable

2021-07-17 10:33:32.000 Dean:    it is strange how the human eye notices the reflections even when they are ever so faint

2021-07-17 10:31:59.000 Dean:    I have a notion to recreate the clock using GDI+ so that I can create a clock of the same calibre and quality
2021-07-17 10:31:18.000 Dean:    
2021-07-17 10:31:13.000 Dean:    the window reflection was just placed manually in a spot that looked correct
2021-07-17 10:30:52.000 Dean:    from memory the 'big' reflection overlaps the surround a little emulating a glass cover
2021-07-17 10:30:12.000 Dean:    and the relative co-ords could be derived
2021-07-17 10:29:48.000 Dean:    the 'glass areas' are layered above
2021-07-17 10:29:29.000 Dean:    but in any of the panzer widgets
2021-07-17 10:29:17.000 Dean:    as VB6 can't handle the layering
2021-07-17 10:29:05.000 Dean:    Well, no as I used a flat resized image as per yours

2021-07-16 14:35:54.000 Dean:    made them slightly larger on the reduced size to make them useful
2021-07-16 14:35:33.000 Dean:    I added the second and date windows, easy to do in the VB6 IDE
2021-07-16 14:26:24.000 Dean:    youir rescaled image has the same limitations as mine in FCW
2021-07-16 14:26:02.000 Dean:    doesn't the YWE do a very good job of scaling from a alrge image to a small?
2021-07-16 14:19:22.000 Dean:    and no resizing...
2021-07-16 14:19:15.000 Dean:    but they are so small as to be almnost useless
2021-07-16 14:19:04.000 Dean:    date and seconds missing on mine
2021-07-16 13:46:48.000 Dean:    in fact cpu usae for FCW is practically at zero all the time
2021-07-16 13:46:32.000 Dean:    I tested the timer disabling on VB6 but it made zero difference to do so
2021-07-16 13:45:40.000 Dean:    then perhaps it is triggering more interpretation of what is going on and passing it "down the line" as it were
2021-07-16 13:44:54.000 Dean:    if the frame allows more functionality such as extra rendering of objects
2021-07-16 13:44:26.000 Dean:    if a frame is just that, a logical grouping then it should not matter
2021-07-16 13:43:22.000 Dean:    same code or similar?
2021-07-16 13:42:20.000 Dean:    dropbox, Avast and Windows itself are the main culprits
2021-07-16 13:41:56.000 Dean:    but the YWE are not the critical component
2021-07-16 13:41:46.000 Dean:    RAM still always an issue with windows
2021-07-16 13:41:33.000 Dean:    cpu is not really an issue with regard to the widget load
2021-07-16 13:41:11.000 Dean:    when we first created them, the machines we had available to us meant that cpu and memory usage was much more critical
2021-07-16 13:40:38.000 Dean:    in general less than 4% for all YWE widgets (21)
2021-07-16 13:30:25.000 Dean:    5-7% cpu usage for a smooth running second hand on the E6410
2021-07-16 13:24:22.000 Dean:    it is only for display

2021-07-15 20:32:48.000 Dean:    was it a timestamp comparison?

2021-07-15 20:32:17.000 Dean:    wakefromsleep - did you try the old widget on Win to see if it does the same?
2021-07-15 19:44:41.000 Dean:    that's about all I can do
2021-07-15 19:44:33.000 Dean:    and remove you from it

2021-07-15 19:44:01.000 Dean:    nothing I can do about it
2021-07-15 19:21:13.000 Dean:    on FCW BTW, the fire button is there by default, the clock only appears when the top left screw is pressed
2021-07-15 19:08:38.000 Dean:    so it might not get into FCW for a while
2021-07-15 19:08:27.000 Dean:    I'm coming to an end with FCW soon

2021-07-15 10:40:35.000 Dean:    as he has a very sarcastic and almost caustic way of responsing to requests for help
2021-07-15 10:40:02.000 Dean:    The dev Olaf Schmidt is a bugger to work with though
2021-07-15 10:39:35.000 Dean:    it is possible that with a set of libraries called RC5/6 these sorts of improved animations may be possible
2021-07-15 10:39:00.000 Dean:    still, though it'll do
2021-07-15 10:38:54.000 Dean:    but in comparison with the YWE version it is a retrograde step

2021-07-14 22:52:01.000 Dean:    personally I think bringing in the stopwatch functionality is overkill
2021-07-14 22:51:33.000 Dean:    by 'telling" it to move there
2021-07-14 22:51:10.000 Dean:    with the YWE you could simply place the stop watch in place automatically
2021-07-14 22:50:44.000 Dean:

2021-07-14 22:46:34.000 Dean:    not quite as good as the YWE version as the hands have to be drawn using code
2021-07-14 22:45:55.000 Dean:    We both implemented the same thing at the same time

2021-07-14 13:44:34.000 Dean:    it will be based upon the stopwatch widget without the stopwatch features
2021-07-14 13:44:13.000 Dean:    FCW I am working on an analog clock which will replace the FIRE button

2021-07-13 16:35:37.000 Dean:    as SD does a lot of process and window analysis

2021-07-13 16:33:54.000 Dean:    
2021-07-13 16:33:49.000 Dean:    for virus barrier
2021-07-13 16:33:38.000 Dean:    I suggest you add the dropbox cache folder to the excluded list
2021-07-13 16:33:14.000 Dean:    and that is the closest it gets to do doing something the o/s would normally do
2021-07-13 16:32:49.000 Dean:    so it can see and read binary streams fron those files
2021-07-13 16:32:24.000 Dean:    it has a few methods of identifying file types
2021-07-13 16:31:41.000 Dean:    it is doing nothing special
2021-07-13 16:31:34.000 Dean:    There is nothing special in the code that would cause it to trigger a positive
2021-07-13 16:31:07.000 Dean:    it is seeing a VB6 binary and deciding it is a virus just because it is using VB6
2021-07-13 16:30:37.000 Dean:    Well, virusBarrier is not the best a/v tool then
2021-07-13 16:01:03.000 Dean:    just checked using 'everything'
2021-07-13 16:00:48.000 Dean:    and I have no files withthose names on my system
2021-07-13 16:00:34.000 Dean:    but they would have a suffix
2021-07-13 15:59:01.000 Dean:    of that type
2021-07-13 15:58:55.000 Dean:    it often has a ridiculous filename for that type
2021-07-13 15:58:38.000 Dean:    when I download an image from Facebook
2021-07-13 15:57:41.000 Dean:    hold on
2021-07-13 15:57:23.000 Dean:    nope
2021-07-13 13:53:31.000 Dean:    lovely here
2021-07-13 13:48:13.000 Dean:    almost as if the a/v tool is checking it?

2021-07-13 10:41:16.000 Dean:    and I have created two new forms as tests for moving the config data to a form to overcome the 255 controls limit
2021-07-13 10:40:44.000 Dean:    it bounces much more quickly
2021-07-13 10:40:29.000 Dean:    On VB6 SD I have increased the animation interval and the bounceZone to make the bounce smaller and less cpu bound
2021-07-13 10:39:07.000 Dean:    so appreciated...
2021-07-13 10:39:00.000 Dean:    Lucy looked after Mum today so I had a sleep in

2021-07-12 21:01:39.000 Dean:    not ood eh?
2021-07-12 21:01:31.000 Dean:    so you are stuck between a rock and a hard place
2021-07-12 21:01:18.000 Dean:    if I do convert to control arrays, they are not supported under VB.NET preventing migration completely.
2021-07-12 21:00:49.000 Dean:    
2021-07-12 21:00:44.000 Dean:    and see how it works out
2021-07-12 21:00:38.000 Dean:    so I am going to try to give that a go
2021-07-12 21:00:29.000 Dean:    but possible
2021-07-12 21:00:25.000 Dean:    painful
2021-07-12 21:00:21.000 Dean:    and when you move the main form you have to move the child form too and place it exactly
2021-07-12 20:59:59.000 Dean:    then you have to place the new tab/form on top of the old master form
2021-07-12 20:59:29.000 Dean:    
2021-07-12 20:59:28.000 Dean:    and adjusting the code accordingly
2021-07-12 20:59:19.000 Dean:    so then it is a matter of moving the code that underlies each control to the new form
2021-07-12 20:58:45.000 Dean:    they just exist on a different form
2021-07-12 20:58:37.000 Dean:    all names are preserved during the copy
2021-07-12 20:58:24.000 Dean:    I have to create a Windowless form and copy the whole tab frame to the new form
2021-07-12 20:57:53.000 Dean:    for each tab in dockSettings 
2021-07-12 20:57:40.000 Dean:    so, a workaround
2021-07-12 20:57:31.000 Dean:     but it is a bit of a backward step when you have been naming all controls according to a good standard
2021-07-12 20:57:07.000 Dean:    I could set all labels into a control array and gain some more space
2021-07-12 20:56:41.000 Dean:    and that is rubbish
2021-07-12 20:56:36.000 Dean:    but the controls have to have one generic name and are referenced by number alone
2021-07-12 20:56:11.000 Dean:    You can create control arrays that are, obviously arrays of controls
2021-07-12 20:55:49.000 Dean:    and I'm over the 255 control limit tha VB6 has per form
2021-07-12 20:55:29.000 Dean:    I have just tried to add a control to dockSettings to handle the 'bounceZone' of the icon bounce when you click on an icon in the dock
2021-07-12 20:54:38.000 Dean:    That's great!

2021-07-12 11:58:51.000 Dean:    as I have a listbox and the contents are easy to access I could add an EDIT option to allow editing of previous posts

2021-07-12 11:57:45.000 Dean:    unknown image types &c
2021-07-12 11:57:36.000 Dean:    but all others have their icon shown
2021-07-12 11:57:28.000 Dean:    so PNGs &c are shown as images
2021-07-12 11:57:08.000 Dean:    I only show the icons for the types that can't be displayed
2021-07-12 11:40:08.000 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2021-07-12 11:40:02.000 Dean:    FCW shows the last received attachment icon and then a ny selection in the listbox updates it
2021-07-12 11:39:17.000 Dean:    You;d have to create a pseudo listbox to do the same
2021-07-12 11:38:44.000 Dean:    it is easy here as a click on the listbox gives complete and instant access to all in that line
2021-07-12 11:38:20.000 Dean:    yes, I imagined that would be tricky
2021-07-12 11:21:53.000 Dean:    it opens in the default application
2021-07-12 11:21:44.000 Dean:    and if I dblClick that
2021-07-12 11:21:33.000 Dean:    if I select a line in the listbox with a new file: attachment then it auto-shows the correct icon in the imagebox

2021-07-12 11:18:51.000 Dean:    re: array.sort, VB6 does not have in-built functions as far as I am aware

2021-07-12 11:17:27.000 Dean:    that you will find on dropbox VB6 under resources
2021-07-12 11:17:07.000 Dean:    it displays known file icons from a folder of known types
2021-07-12 11:16:44.000 Dean:    and it was not much of a change to allow it to handle other types
2021-07-12 11:16:30.000 Dean:    as it shows image attachements 
2021-07-12 11:15:19.000 Dean:    it seemed sensible to do so
2021-07-12 11:06:50.000 Dean:    I've added a quicksort but not yet applied it to a merge of the two windows
2021-07-12 11:06:29.000 Dean:    
2021-07-12 11:06:18.000 Dean:    probably not worth the change but I will add a count anyway

2021-07-12 11:04:14.000 Dean:    they are the type of person that will be really frustrated by you driving at the correct speed
2021-07-12 11:03:52.000 Dean:    Remember with the 30mph tailgating, that by driving sensibly and within the limits you are already doing them more pain than they do to you
2021-07-12 11:03:12.000 Dean:    
2021-07-12 11:03:07.000 Dean:    I'll add that
2021-07-12 11:02:56.000 Dean:    otherwise ignore it and retry
2021-07-12 11:02:46.000 Dean:    and if it counts two such events then report the message
2021-07-12 11:02:27.000 Dean:    I suppose a count of the occurrence might be sensible
2021-07-12 10:59:51.000 Dean:    I'm sure it does test but does it report? have you ever seen one?
2021-07-12 10:59:26.000 Dean:    does js FC test for existence before reading the file and report if it does not exist at that time?
2021-07-12 10:58:48.000 Dean:    so, potentially something, a condition to cater for
2021-07-12 10:58:29.000 Dean:    after clearing the message all continued on as before
2021-07-12 10:58:15.000 Dean:    
2021-07-12 10:58:13.000 Dean:    and I have never seen it before
2021-07-12 10:58:02.000 Dean:    the polling frequency is not short being currently set to 30 secs
2021-07-12 10:57:35.000 Dean:    the code wasn't checking for characteristics of the file, just for existence
2021-07-12 10:57:17.000 Dean:    so I must have caught it just as a new version was being written
2021-07-12 10:56:57.000 Dean:    no drive issues, the input/output files were defined in prefs
2021-07-12 10:56:33.000 Dean:    
2021-07-12 10:53:09.000 Dean:    and I'd caught it at that point
2021-07-12 10:52:51.000 Dean:    as if the file was being deleted and recreated
2021-07-12 10:52:39.000 Dean:    and at that time it did not for a split second, exist
2021-07-12 10:52:08.000 Dean:    as if the file was caught during an update by Dropbox
2021-07-12 10:51:02.000 Dean:    that was from a regular poll and a simple file exists check
2021-07-12 10:50:15.000 Dean:    the local copy here in the shared area
2021-07-12 10:49:55.000 Dean:    I just had a message from FCW that it could not access the shared input file
2021-07-12 10:41:31.000 Dean:    Ahah!
2021-07-12 10:05:37.000 Dean:

2021-07-12 10:05:21.000 Dean:    Are you just used to that convention or is the Enter key not working on js FC
2021-07-12 10:04:55.000 Dean:    I note you are still using the "." to separate or paragraph your messages
2021-07-12 09:59:19.000 Dean:    There are checks for file existence prior to responding to a double-click
2021-07-12 09:59:01.000 Dean:    Oh yes, of course
2021-07-12 09:40:48.000 Dean:    it is vital to hear all the pips
2021-07-12 09:40:29.000 Dean:    of course

2021-07-12 09:25:46.000 Dean:    then after that, response to a PING
2021-07-12 09:25:28.000 Dean:    then the handling of the image types it encounters and what FCW will do with them 
2021-07-12 09:24:49.000 Dean:    today I plan to create three new specific icon images to cater for missing images, unknown image types and unknown attachment types

2021-07-11 22:04:24.000 Dean:    ctrl/c is working well
2021-07-11 21:58:05.000 Dean:    Working on ensuring ctrl/c does the right thing depending upon which window is selected
2021-07-11 21:42:29.000 Dean:    enabled keypresses for the window so I can enable F5 refresh and ctrl/c to copy
2021-07-11 19:18:47.000 Dean:    slowly but surely
2021-07-11 19:10:26.000 Dean:    at the mo' I am just making the technology function in VB6
2021-07-11 19:10:07.000 Dean:    will do when I am certain as to how it will look/operate
2021-07-11 18:25:20.000 Dean:    then it shows a missing file image
2021-07-11 18:24:55.000 Dean:    if the image is missing (we delete old images) from the exchange but the associated texts remain
2021-07-11 18:24:15.000 Dean:    if the image type is not recognised is shows an unknown image
2021-07-11 18:23:52.000 Dean:    when the displayed image is double-clicked the associated app is run
2021-07-11 18:23:22.000 Dean:    as long as it is recognised
2021-07-11 18:23:15.000 Dean:    FCW now recognises lots of file types and displays an appropriate icon for each
2021-07-11 17:40:53.000 Dean:    very poor compression
2021-07-11 17:40:45.000 Dean:    wavs are massive

2021-07-11 12:59:10.000 FCW Dean:    making steady progress
2021-07-11 12:53:47.000 FCW:    weather improving

2021-07-10 21:53:31.000 FCW:    just getting round to watching it
2021-07-10 21:53:23.000 FCW:    that laser video you sent a link for

2021-07-10 21:19:03.000 FCW:    just had 40 winks, amazing how it refreshes you
2021-07-10 21:18:34.000 FCW:    you know how it is, after a while you can forget your own methods...
2021-07-10 21:18:12.000 FCW:    
2021-07-10 21:18:09.000 FCW:    I have also documented the VB6 method of adding a menu to a 'special' form so that the title bar does not become visible
2021-07-10 21:17:02.000 FCW:    so that if I need to do it in the future it will be easy
2021-07-10 21:16:40.000 FCW:    I have just documented the methods by which I manage to make VB6 recognise 'foreign' image formats

2021-07-10 18:38:13.000 FCW:    ?
2021-07-10 18:38:11.000 FCW:    Do you have image files with .CUR suffix
2021-07-10 17:44:50.000 FCW:    which is quite ridiculous but that's Lucy...
2021-07-10 17:44:32.000 FCW:    as Lucy is cooking and she hasn't even started yet

2021-07-10 16:30:08.000 FCW:    I just have two menu options, to re-open the main program and to close it
2021-07-10 16:29:33.000 FCW:    once in FCW and again in SD
2021-07-10 16:29:23.000 FCW:    and I;ve used this method twice now
2021-07-10 16:29:07.000 FCW:    anyway it works
2021-07-10 16:29:02.000 FCW:    using a flaw in VB6 possibly...
2021-07-10 16:28:44.000 FCW:    and it displays! regardless of the forms visibility
2021-07-10 16:28:18.000 FCW:    then, when you want a menu you set the right click to call the menu on the invisible form
2021-07-10 16:27:53.000 FCW:    and you keep it invisible
2021-07-10 16:27:41.000 FCW:    all the code relating to the menu operation is contained there
2021-07-10 16:27:18.000 FCW:    so, the solution is to create a hidden form, place the menu on there and make that invisible
2021-07-10 16:26:49.000 FCW:    disabled
2021-07-10 16:26:46.000 FCW:    even if it is deisabled at design and runtime
2021-07-10 16:26:35.000 FCW:    if you add a menu to a visible form it automatically receives a title bar at the top
2021-07-10 16:26:06.000 FCW:    much more difficult than it should be
2021-07-10 16:25:57.000 FCW:    Added a right click menu to the iconised stamp image

2021-07-10 14:07:55.000 FCW:    but hard to extract data

2021-07-09 20:40:58.000 FCW:    windows only works with file suffixes
2021-07-09 19:11:49.000 FCW:    understood
2021-07-09 16:02:30.000 FCW:    JUST TESTING THINGS
2021-07-09 16:02:19.000 FCW:    Working on several mini projects, dilutes the effort but makes coding bearable, and you?
2021-07-09 16:02:18.000 FCW:    Working on my current project, as always, are you working on anything?
2021-07-09 16:01:58.000 FCW:    Busy coding here, and you?

2021-07-09 16:00:36.000 FCW:    Working on my current project, as always, are you working on anything?
2021-07-09 15:17:24.000 FCW:    good progress made today
2021-07-09 14:46:38.000 FCW:    but it works very well and it shows a lot of knowledge of what is going on under the bonnet when Windows/OsX reads an ICO
2021-07-09 14:45:37.000 FCW:    not the best code in some respects
2021-07-09 14:45:27.000 FCW:    he wrote it some time ago and so probably needs updating
2021-07-09 14:44:35.000 FCW:    It reads the original image using GDI+ then converts it into something that a standard VB6 picture box can cope with
2021-07-09 14:43:14.000 FCW:    someone called LaVolpe wrote one of those class files for each image type that VB6 cannot cater for, ones that it is likely to encounter
2021-07-09 14:42:25.000 FCW:    I did not write that obviously
2021-07-09 14:24:08.000 FCW:    but runs fast, thank goodness
2021-07-09 14:23:59.000 FCW:    it is hefty
2021-07-09 14:23:53.000 FCW:    into something that is portable across programs
2021-07-09 14:23:41.000 FCW:    that is the 'class' file that enapsulates VB6's icon reading capability
2021-07-09 14:23:12.000 FCW:    <><>StdPictureEx.cls
2021-07-09 14:21:22.000 FCW:    the last icon it encounters
2021-07-09 14:20:13.000 FCW:    t
2021-07-09 14:20:01.000 FCW:    and so all muy mulyi-icons are ordered biggest first to facilitate that
2021-07-09 14:19:22.000 FCW:    if I drop a multi ico straight onto the dock, then it uses just GDI+/Windows to read the icon and it find the largest one automatically
2021-07-09 14:18:29.000 FCW:    that might be the difference between unix/windows
2021-07-09 14:18:16.000 FCW:    automatically
2021-07-09 14:18:11.000 FCW:    and others find the last icon
2021-07-09 14:17:53.000 FCW:    the thing about the multiple icons is that some programs read a multi0icon file using the size as a reference, some select the first icon in the file that they can identify as an icon
2021-07-09 14:16:59.000 FCW:    
2021-07-09 14:11:52.000 FCW:    you don't have the new graphics, they won't be ready for a while
2021-07-09 14:11:24.000 FCW:    if so, then you have my version
2021-07-09 14:11:16.000 FCW:    can you see if you have a confirmation when the delete button is pressed?
2021-07-09 14:10:51.000 FCW:    I added some confirmations on widget deletion
2021-07-09 14:10:36.000 FCW:    I think I have a version of startup mgr that is different to yours
2021-07-09 14:10:14.000 FCW:    it has done that to me
2021-07-09 14:10:00.000 FCW:    export to json?
2021-07-09 14:09:19.000 FCW:    import new settings
2021-07-09 14:08:57.000 FCW:    export?
2021-07-09 13:01:07.000 FCW:    so, possibly multiple icons were not a thing when konfabulator was created
2021-07-09 12:59:47.000 FCW:    which is normal for Windows
2021-07-09 12:59:39.000 FCW:    then you will see all the icons are multiple ICOs
2021-07-09 12:59:24.000 FCW:    on Win
2021-07-09 12:59:21.000 FCW:    if you look at the .ico files in C:\Program Files (x86)\SteamyDock\iconSettings\my collection\steampunk icons MKII
2021-07-09 12:58:43.000 FCW:    <><>sixteenIco.png
2021-07-09 12:56:50.000 FCW:    at the moment it extracts the 16x16 icon and sets it full size128x128 or similar
2021-07-09 12:56:13.000 FCW:    is it possible to state a size to extract?
2021-07-09 12:55:50.000 FCW:    when you have an icon with multi icons inside it seems to find the last icon in the list
2021-07-09 12:54:48.000 FCW:    it interprets multiple icons incorrectly
2021-07-09 12:54:33.000 FCW:    it almost works
2021-07-09 11:25:52.000 FCW:    a quick search shows no code resources for reading ICNS using VB6
2021-07-09 11:22:07.000 FCW:    not easy
2021-07-09 11:22:01.000 FCW:    ICNS on VB6... Hmmmm
2021-07-09 11:21:49.000 FCW:    both sides
2021-07-09 11:21:44.000 FCW:    if you could see them in FC
2021-07-09 11:21:34.000 FCW:    and swapping designs
2021-07-09 11:21:27.000 FCW:    it would be useful for icon development
2021-07-09 11:21:02.000 FCW:    but I'll bet it uses a Mac API call
2021-07-09 11:20:46.000 FCW:    as that would be interesting
2021-07-09 11:20:34.000 FCW:    I mean showing icns files
2021-07-09 11:20:25.000 FCW:    as that would work in Windows too?
2021-07-09 11:20:04.000 FCW:    ?
2021-07-09 11:19:58.000 FCW:    does it do it nativley or pull code from somewhere else
2021-07-09 11:19:23.000 FCW:    how does it do that?
2021-07-09 11:16:35.000 FCW:    or next rather
2021-07-09 11:15:41.000 FCW:    We might have to build an Android version now
2021-07-09 11:15:30.000 FCW:    So, with the .js version we have Mac accessibility, we have two versions for Windows
2021-07-09 11:14:50.000 FCW:    That's a milestone
2021-07-09 11:11:32.000 FCW:    but I'm pleased with the fact that it is all fundamentally working
2021-07-09 11:11:05.000 FCW:    just refining the operation, centre-ing the .ico image
2021-07-09 10:56:14.000 FCW:    slightly better with .ico
2021-07-09 10:55:53.000 FCW:    I'm doing well then
2021-07-09 10:40:43.000 FCW:    by opening Photoshop...
2021-07-09 10:40:32.000 FCW:    Windows even handled the PICT type
2021-07-09 10:40:18.000 FCW:    What does YWE baulk upon?
2021-07-09 10:39:08.000 FCW:    that'll do it
2021-07-09 10:39:04.000 FCW:    and allow a click through so that Windows can open any that are not recognised
2021-07-09 10:38:41.000 FCW:    and I will create an unknown image picture for the others
2021-07-09 10:38:04.000 FCW:    If I support a smattering of the main types that are likely to be dropped, that'll do
2021-07-09 10:37:38.000 FCW:    but not now
2021-07-09 10:37:30.000 FCW:    I could use WIA Windows Image Acquisition to do the rest and I'll consider that
2021-07-09 10:37:03.000 FCW:    and it does a raw reading of each file type
2021-07-09 10:36:51.000 FCW:    it has to have a separate conversion cls for each type
2021-07-09 10:36:37.000 FCW:    it is just my utility cannot
2021-07-09 10:36:29.000 FCW:    and all the others you have sent me
2021-07-09 10:36:21.000 FCW:    all
2021-07-09 10:36:12.000 FCW:    Windows can handle them
2021-07-09 10:35:40.000 FCW:    .jpg,.jpeg,.bmp,.ico,.png,.tif,.tiff,.gif,.ico
2021-07-09 10:34:55.000 FCW:    I am only going to show a select few
2021-07-09 10:34:45.000 FCW:    looking good
2021-07-09 10:19:00.000 FCW:    and working!
2021-07-09 10:18:55.000 FCW:    it is showing the image formats that I expected it to show
2021-07-09 10:18:41.000 FCW:    I knpw what I have to do now
2021-07-09 10:18:32.000 FCW:    one final test
2021-07-09 10:18:23.000 FCW:    do you have a .BMP?
2021-07-09 10:18:11.000 FCW:    i
2021-07-09 10:18:10.000 FCW:    it is handling .ico but not .cns
2021-07-09 10:08:31.000 FCW:    I know it has .icns and .hqx
2021-07-09 10:08:18.000 FCW:    I'm unsure
2021-07-09 10:08:01.000 FCW:    does os/x have .ico?
2021-07-09 10:07:51.000 FCW:    I have plenty I could send you but I know they are all Win based and they work
2021-07-09 10:07:24.000 FCW:    do you have an .ico that you can send me?
2021-07-09 10:05:47.000 FCW:    I don't encounter them often
2021-07-09 10:05:36.000 FCW:    just hoping for a different one
2021-07-09 10:03:17.000 FCW:    two FFs
2021-07-09 10:02:52.000 FCW:    send another tiff please
2021-07-09 10:01:33.000 FCW:    TIFis working fine

2021-07-09 09:45:53.000 FCW:    .TIF suffix

2021-07-08 23:37:50.000 FCW:    PNGs only for a bit
2021-07-08 23:37:45.000 FCW:    another PNG pls
2021-07-08 22:53:49.000 FCW:    send me a png please
2021-07-08 21:44:28.000 FCW:    send me a .jpg please 
2021-07-08 21:20:37.000 FCW:    for each control auto-created
2021-07-08 21:20:16.000 FCW:    the form_unload does it now
2021-07-08 21:18:33.000 FCW:    but it doesn't
2021-07-08 21:18:18.000 FCW:    I didn't know that before assuming VB6 tidies memory automatically
2021-07-08 21:17:53.000 FCW:    those image or pic boxes must be deleted when the program ends
2021-07-08 21:17:29.000 FCW:    When the prog starts it creates image boxes dynamically to place all the icons in the map
2021-07-08 21:17:00.000 FCW:    I just fixed a potential memory  leak  on the iconSettings tool
2021-07-08 21:16:32.000 FCW:    it is exactly what I need
2021-07-08 19:45:43.000 FCW:    I will incorporate that spec
2021-07-08 19:45:08.000 FCW:    very tasty
2021-07-08 19:44:38.000 FCW:    made fried pork belly with peas, red onion and red peppers in teriyaki, garlic and honey on a bed of rice
2021-07-08 19:43:52.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 19:42:51.000 FCW:    and useful
2021-07-08 19:42:47.000 FCW:    That#s really good
2021-07-08 16:42:05.000 FCW:    possibly
2021-07-08 16:38:19.000 FCW:    still running but not doing anything
2021-07-08 16:38:09.000 FCW:    Dropbox had a wobbly
2021-07-08 16:07:02.000 FCW:    worth searching for and reading up
2021-07-08 16:06:49.000 FCW:    about spyware
2021-07-08 16:06:43.000 FCW:    there is a furore about Audacity at the mo'
2021-07-08 16:06:28.000 FCW:    I use audcity
2021-07-08 16:06:18.000 FCW:    so I have to convert to WAV 
2021-07-08 16:06:09.000 FCW:    VB6 cannot read mp3 files
2021-07-08 16:05:50.000 FCW:    very good
2021-07-08 16:02:17.000 FCW:    Dropbox died
2021-07-08 16:00:53.000 FCW:    everything OK your end?
2021-07-08 14:48:17.000 FCW:    what do you think?
2021-07-08 14:16:20.000 FCW:    and the factory model is taking shape with planks onthe shed extension
2021-07-08 14:15:59.000 FCW:    the one I use for SD card storage
2021-07-08 14:15:51.000 FCW:    better attempt and spine repairs on an old book

2021-07-08 10:20:03.000 FCW:    and it is in.
2021-07-08 10:19:58.000 FCW:    but I have it
2021-07-08 10:19:48.000 FCW:    I now need to test it and see how to make it work again! Forgotten
2021-07-08 10:19:05.000 FCW:    not too difficult as it is modular
2021-07-08 10:18:48.000 FCW:    I just managed to incorporate the complex image type reading code that is used in the  iconSettings tool to give FCW the ability to read 'foreign' image types such as PNGs
2021-07-08 10:17:34.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 09:55:57.000 FCW:    I'll add that to the list
2021-07-08 09:55:44.000 FCW:    I must finish the Help and make it look a little more professional
2021-07-08 09:55:08.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 09:54:59.000 FCW:    but I am familiar with it
2021-07-08 09:54:49.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 09:54:47.000 FCW:    NVU
2021-07-08 09:54:42.000 FCW:    The tool I use sometimes does its relative linksn thing and does it wrong
2021-07-08 09:54:12.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 09:54:11.000 FCW:    is that all you changed?
2021-07-08 09:54:03.000 FCW:    was it the relative links to some images that was broken?
2021-07-08 09:53:48.000 FCW:    Harry, when you changed the FCW HTML help
2021-07-08 09:53:34.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 09:47:25.000 FCW:    good to see it working as built
2021-07-08 09:47:11.000 FCW:    and it was unable to connect to the dropbox shared location
2021-07-08 09:46:47.000 FCW:    I was connected to a more remote wireless link in the house
2021-07-08 09:46:19.000 FCW:    and went off just as the JS version
2021-07-08 09:46:06.000 FCW:    the sharing alarm just worked
2021-07-08 09:42:32.000 FCW:     Windspeed is 8 knots, force 3, direction SSW

2021-07-08 09:42:04.000 FCW:    awake but busy looking after mum
2021-07-08 09:39:29.000 FCW:    morning
2021-07-08 00:09:54.000 FCW:    GoodNigit Harry!

2021-07-08 00:09:42.000 FCW:    goodnight
2021-07-08 00:08:32.000 FCW:    I'll give him those and see how he gets on
2021-07-08 00:07:57.000 FCW:    but the list is not large
2021-07-08 00:07:49.000 FCW:    so a few tasks to do
2021-07-08 00:07:42.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 00:06:30.000 FCW:    ' F5 and ctrl/c
2021-07-08 00:06:15.000 FCW:    ' quicksort to merge both input boxes - we have code
2021-07-08 00:06:07.000 FCW:    ' add awake timer

2021-07-08 00:04:31.000 FCW:    one item per day
2021-07-08 00:04:28.000 FCW:    I am fixing bugs/adding functionality 
2021-07-08 00:04:13.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 00:04:11.000 FCW:    and try it out
2021-07-08 00:04:02.000 FCW:    so you can have a copy
2021-07-08 00:03:56.000 FCW:    I will begin to create the manifest soon
2021-07-08 00:03:20.000 FCW:    it is eminently usable
2021-07-08 00:03:07.000 FCW:    I am really enjoying using FCW
2021-07-08 00:02:56.000 FCW:    
2021-07-08 00:02:20.000 FCW:    (and teach myself too!)
2021-07-08 00:02:11.000 FCW:    as he grows and shows more interest I will expose him to more advanced stuff
2021-07-08 00:01:29.000 FCW:    the important thing is that he enjoys everything he learns
2021-07-08 00:01:01.000 FCW:    he enjoys maths and wants to do well in it (and does) but he is not a maths progidy
2021-07-08 00:00:37.000 FCW:    too advanced for him I think
2021-07-07 23:58:49.000 FCW:    so regularly that it embarasses her
2021-07-07 23:58:31.000 FCW:    and tries to burn the house down
2021-07-07 23:58:23.000 FCW:    she always says yes but then always does exactly what she wants
2021-07-07 23:58:02.000 FCW:    she should never be let near the Rayburn, I have told her time and time again to never turn it above level two
2021-07-07 23:57:31.000 FCW:    the temperature was so high I had to open the oven fully and open all the kitchen doors and windows
2021-07-07 23:56:57.000 FCW:    could have burnt the house down
2021-07-07 23:56:50.000 FCW:    the only reason I am awake is that Lucy left the Rayburn oven on full and went to bed
2021-07-07 23:56:03.000 FCW:    really good idea
2021-07-07 23:55:39.000 FCW:    loves maths and science, especially quantum physics
2021-07-07 23:55:22.000 FCW:    he has that sort of brain
2021-07-07 23:55:09.000 FCW:    he can watch telly, use a phone and answer any question about the film or surroundings or even the current conversations
2021-07-07 23:54:22.000 FCW:    he has the skill of being able to listen to multiple sources of information simultaneously
2021-07-07 23:53:43.000 FCW:    with a fascination for all things that you and I appreciate
2021-07-07 23:53:22.000 FCW:    small but a good looking and very clever boy
2021-07-07 23:53:06.000 FCW:    13 years old
2021-07-07 23:49:14.000 FCW:    not going anywhere
2021-07-07 23:49:07.000 FCW:    yes
2021-07-07 22:44:09.000 FCW:    trying to entertain him
2021-07-07 22:43:48.000 FCW:    and he is all well
2021-07-07 22:43:44.000 FCW:    but reports no symptoms
2021-07-07 22:43:35.000 FCW:    boy is still home after exposure to covid
2021-07-07 22:42:36.000 FCW:    could do with one of those
2021-07-07 22:42:29.000 FCW:    nice mat
2021-07-07 22:01:46.000 FCW:    the other side is damaged
2021-07-07 22:01:41.000 FCW:    of abuse
2021-07-07 22:01:33.000 FCW:    s
2021-07-07 22:01:32.000 FCW:    it has survived decadea
2021-07-07 22:01:17.000 FCW:    the only thing  I don't use on it is a rotarycutter
2021-07-07 22:00:49.000 FCW:    I abuse it
2021-07-07 22:00:41.000 FCW:    yes

2021-07-07 20:59:27.000 FCW:    and no real hard sun
2021-07-07 20:59:19.000 FCW:    the air is warm but gentle drizzle is on/off
2021-07-07 20:59:02.000 FCW:    thin
2021-07-07 20:58:58.000 FCW:    high level mist or low level cloud
2021-07-07 20:58:43.000 FCW:    weather was mild all day
2021-07-07 20:58:29.000 FCW:    want sausages
2021-07-07 20:58:25.000 FCW:    
2021-07-07 20:58:20.000 FCW:    but I am now putting the $ back in all my code
2021-07-07 20:58:07.000 FCW:    that modern programmers would not do
2021-07-07 20:57:57.000 FCW:    I had stopped using the $ considering it "old hat"
2021-07-07 20:57:42.000 FCW:    anything else and it brings other functions into play
2021-07-07 20:57:28.000 FCW:    putting the $ there makes it do only strings and therefore only uses the string code
2021-07-07 20:56:56.000 FCW:    however your code is faster when you explicitly state the $ afterwards as it forces VB6 to not attempt type conversions which supposedly it does
2021-07-07 20:56:00.000 FCW:    same for all the other string functions
2021-07-07 20:55:52.000 FCW:    nowadays they are not needed so it is simply len and mid
2021-07-07 20:55:35.000 FCW:    mid$, len$ &c
2021-07-07 20:55:22.000 FCW:    all the string functions have an optional $ after each from the BASIC old days
2021-07-07 20:54:55.000 FCW:    I learnty something today about VB6
2021-07-07 20:54:46.000 FCW:    so mine is an easy mid$ string extraction to the len$ of the string
2021-07-07 20:54:08.000 FCW:    just a simple string substitution and none of the unix style control
2021-07-07 20:53:46.000 FCW:    the VB6 replace command is substantially different
2021-07-07 20:53:12.000 FCW:    good use of the replace command
2021-07-07 15:14:52.000 FCW:    no need to change
2021-07-07 15:14:43.000 FCW:    the text is fine, FCW is handling it all well
2021-07-07 13:52:51.000 FCW:    time is reset
2021-07-07 13:31:55.000 FCW:    an edit option might be nice later
2021-07-07 13:31:42.000 FCW:    don't plan to add that as there is no need at the moment
2021-07-07 13:31:27.000 FCW:    not at the moment though
2021-07-07 13:31:19.000 FCW:    I can delete or even edit a line
2021-07-07 13:31:11.000 FCW:    I can operate on the individual lines quite easily
2021-07-07 13:30:43.000 FCW:    on the multiple line select, even with 1800 lines  there is no obvious delay extracting the selected lines
2021-07-07 13:30:02.000 FCW:    and it is very fast to operate
2021-07-07 13:29:48.000 FCW:    not that I've needed any
2021-07-07 13:29:38.000 FCW:    and of course having been around so long there are code snippets for anything you might like to do
2021-07-07 13:29:05.000 FCW:    the listbox is a useful control
2021-07-07 13:28:53.000 FCW:    and that seems to do the trick
2021-07-07 13:28:44.000 FCW:    to remove any preceding spaces in the user prefix
2021-07-07 13:28:11.000 FCW:    trimmed the result
2021-07-07 13:28:06.000 FCW:    then extracted from there to the end of the line
2021-07-07 13:27:51.000 FCW:    after the timestamp
2021-07-07 13:27:40.000 FCW:    I have just searched for the first four spaces in the line
2021-07-07 13:27:17.000 FCW:    yes I have that issue
2021-07-07 12:34:06.000 FCW:    FCW now handling multiline copy/pastes from the listboxes
2021-07-07 12:33:34.000 FCW:    seems to be working...
2021-07-07 12:32:57.000 FCW:    No projects on the go at the moment - car needs a wash and a run.
2021-07-07 12:32:57.000 FCW:    Ta Ta For Now!

2021-07-07 10:51:14.000 FCW:    what a to-do
2021-07-07 10:50:54.000 FCW:    and you have to loop through the whole list box and extract all the ticked items
2021-07-07 10:50:28.000 FCW:    the selected items in the list are ticked as such
2021-07-07 10:50:05.000 FCW:    you can't just copy the selected items when there are more than one...
2021-07-07 10:49:41.000 FCW:    two is more complicated
2021-07-07 10:49:32.000 FCW:    just one line at the moment
2021-07-07 10:49:03.000 FCW:    t
2021-07-07 10:49:02.000 FCW:    I implemented cut and paste from the FCW listbox just so that I could wach that video
2021-07-07 10:48:39.000 FCW:    Those Sesame steps are impressive
2021-07-07 10:25:33.000 FCW:    just implementing cut/paste from the text boxes

2021-07-06 12:35:10.000 FCW:    then run it and record it there
2021-07-06 12:34:59.000 FCW:    and I have to synch. the code, overcome same installation problems you had
2021-07-06 12:34:29.000 FCW:    unfortunately, the machine I need to use is at the top of the house
2021-07-06 12:34:08.000 FCW:    I understand
2021-07-06 09:43:33.000 FCW:    they are not from Wigan
2021-07-06 09:43:25.000 FCW:    and then divert the calls from India through those
2021-07-06 09:43:12.000 FCW:    They purchase a number of limited use telephone numbers
2021-07-06 09:34:32.000 FCW:    it is a bit frightening for your genuine callers though
2021-07-06 09:34:15.000 FCW:    it works almost every time
2021-07-06 09:34:03.000 FCW:    you just have to sound slightly scary when saying the phone greeting
2021-07-06 09:33:37.000 FCW:    and when the encounter an assured male voice they invariably just disconnect immediately

2021-07-06 09:32:00.000 FCW:    then just put the handset on the table and let them wait
2021-07-06 09:31:47.000 FCW:    one technique is to ask them if they mind holding
2021-07-06 09:31:28.000 FCW:    always.
2021-07-06 09:31:24.000 FCW:    probably?

2021-07-04 18:52:19.000 FCW:    and they have broken win to ensure no-one uses it
2021-07-04 18:52:08.000 FCW:    then they removed it as they had a new product
2021-07-04 18:51:58.000 FCW:    it was part of MS Essentials and came with all win 7 o/s
2021-07-04 18:51:32.000 FCW:    MS has conspired to make movie maker fail!
2021-07-04 18:51:15.000 FCW:    you'll have to wait until I move the binary and get it working on another device
2021-07-04 18:50:53.000 FCW:    sorry
2021-07-04 18:34:45.000 FCW:    totally useless
2021-07-04 18:34:28.000 FCW:    and then failure
2021-07-04 18:33:45.000 FCW:    three mins...
2021-07-04 18:32:21.000 FCW:    75%
2021-07-04 18:32:01.000 FCW:    and the whole CPU is locked up
2021-07-04 18:31:43.000 FCW:    takes a full 2 mins to install
2021-07-04 18:31:21.000 FCW:    MS software is SO bloated
2021-07-04 18:31:10.000 FCW:    25%
2021-07-04 18:28:53.000 FCW:    installing movie maker
2021-07-04 18:22:31.000 FCW:    but it took time to perfect
2021-07-04 18:22:21.000 FCW:    in VB6 it is fairly easy
2021-07-04 18:22:11.000 FCW:    I understand

2021-07-04 18:14:07.000 FCW:    I did it on the last system but this one still does not have all the tools I had access to in the last laptop
2021-07-04 18:13:44.000 FCW:    downloading move maker so I can make a video on this machine
2021-07-04 18:09:33.000 FCW:    the short bit just after the shredding has finished
2021-07-04 18:09:09.000 FCW:    the new strip of paper appears at the top of the emoji area during the shredder's reset sound
2021-07-04 18:08:02.000 FCW:    takes the same time as the sound of the shredding
2021-07-04 18:07:44.000 FCW:    a click and it shreds
2021-07-04 18:07:38.000 FCW:    and stays there until the user interacts with it
2021-07-04 18:07:24.000 FCW:    to the bottom still vertical
2021-07-04 18:07:12.000 FCW:    it falls
2021-07-04 18:07:09.000 FCW:    page-fumble
2021-07-04 18:07:03.000 FCW:    then it stops, as if still attached to the printers thermal roll
2021-07-04 18:06:39.000 FCW:    then slides out smoothly just as a printer does when it is feeding
2021-07-04 18:06:17.000 FCW:    in jerky movements
2021-07-04 18:06:09.000 FCW:    sound starts, the print out starts
2021-07-04 18:05:55.000 FCW:    same amount of time as the sounds
2021-07-04 18:05:23.000 FCW:    .wavs

2021-07-04 17:46:21.000 FCW:    as if it is cutting off the print out
2021-07-04 17:46:12.000 FCW:    the page-fumble runs at the point when the print finishes and the print out 'drops' to the bottom
2021-07-04 17:45:36.000 FCW:    then it stays on until the print is completed
2021-07-04 17:45:20.000 FCW:    that is flashed as if a neon tube is activated with a faulty starter

2021-07-04 14:54:25.000 FCW:    so the synchronisation is only one way 
2021-07-04 14:54:11.000 FCW:    and not the output
2021-07-04 14:53:59.000 FCW:    it seems it only polls and checks the input file

2021-07-04 14:52:33.000 FCW:    can the .js version do the same?

2021-07-03 22:54:58.000 FCW:    just added an option to enable tooltips

2021-07-03 20:32:15.000 FCW:    Is the weather bearable where you are?
2021-07-03 20:31:04.000 FCW:    but it'll do
2021-07-03 20:30:58.000 FCW:    a pity
2021-07-03 20:30:38.000 FCW:    instead I call the Windows font selection tool using the API
2021-07-03 20:30:22.000 FCW:    I can populate a single combobox with fonts and display the results in a separate text box but it is not the same
2021-07-03 20:29:49.000 FCW:    it just does not have the capability natively
2021-07-03 20:29:36.000 FCW:    VB6 cannot create multiple column combo boxes (dropdowns)
2021-07-03 20:29:11.000 FCW:    but was unsuccessful
2021-07-03 20:29:02.000 FCW:    I tried to recreate the two column comboBox used by YWE in the prefs to display the fonts
2021-07-03 20:28:34.000 FCW:    
2021-07-03 20:27:49.000 FCW:    as well as windows vbCrLf

2021-07-03 13:12:41.000 FCW:    How many can you add?
2021-07-03 13:12:20.000 FCW:    very efficient
2021-07-03 12:00:35.000 FCW:    if I do a right click currently then it just clicks
2021-07-03 12:00:04.000 FCW:    So much to do at the moment, hard to find time for anything else.
2021-07-03 11:59:49.000 FCW:    I almost did the same
2021-07-03 11:59:45.000 FCW:    
2021-07-03 11:59:39.000 FCW:    that makes sense
2021-07-03 11:44:59.000 FCW:    but that is a future project
2021-07-03 11:44:51.000 FCW:    at some point I need to convert the database to a form that is maintainable and has a future
2021-07-03 11:44:20.000 FCW:    for the mil.sim software I created before the turn of the century

2021-07-03 11:43:16.000 FCW:    and migrated to VBDOS and VB6

2021-07-03 11:19:00.000 FCW:    then I can get some care/respite

2021-07-03 11:18:44.000 FCW:    after six months

2021-07-03 11:05:53.000 FCW:    as I am using them as examples of loops for my youngest

2021-07-03 11:05:01.000 FCW:    I implemented each button differently when reading the data from the file

2021-07-02 23:36:47.000 FCW:    me too
2021-07-02 21:47:53.000 FCW:    much more these days than before
2021-07-02 21:47:40.000 FCW:    but Windows requires them
2021-07-02 21:47:31.000 FCW:    These manifests weren't a thing once
2021-07-02 21:41:31.000 FCW:    no point in doing it until the program is done and a working delivery can be built
2021-07-02 21:40:58.000 FCW:    creating the manifest and all its dependencies is a chore that has to be left to the end
2021-07-02 21:40:31.000 FCW:    you'll have t wait for a bit, sorry
2021-07-02 21:37:36.000 FCW:    I have to create a manifest for it
2021-07-02 21:02:37.000 FCW:    try it in the same folder and see how it goes
2021-07-02 21:02:24.000 FCW:    so it works for me
2021-07-02 21:02:21.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 21:02:19.000 FCW:    I
2021-07-02 21:02:18.000 FCW:     have it loaded from another folder
2021-07-02 21:02:07.000 FCW:    essential component
2021-07-02 21:01:22.000 FCW:    stick that in the same folder see if it helps

2021-07-02 20:24:56.000 FCW:    prefix &c
2021-07-02 20:24:49.000 FCW:    you can edit settings.ini manually and change certain variables without fear
2021-07-02 20:24:25.000 FCW:    so I don't know what it might do
2021-07-02 20:24:17.000 FCW:    as I haven't run it on a PC without a settings.ini 
2021-07-02 20:23:42.000 FCW:    it might be wise to put it into users\harry\appdata\roaming\firecall\
2021-07-02 20:23:05.000 FCW:    take that settings.ini file I gave you earlier
2021-07-02 20:21:43.000 FCW:    Weeding, bloody weeds!
2021-07-02 20:21:40.000 FCW:    Weather any good today?
2021-07-02 20:21:33.000 FCW:    Working on my current project, as always, are you working on anything?
2021-07-02 20:21:30.000 FCW:    So much to do at the moment, hard to find time for anything else.
2021-07-02 20:21:26.000 FCW:    Are you alright?
2021-07-02 20:14:48.000 FCW:    but it might
2021-07-02 20:14:45.000 FCW:    untested elsewhere
2021-07-02 20:14:36.000 FCW:    and see if it works
2021-07-02 20:14:30.000 FCW:    and try clicking upon the firecall exe
2021-07-02 20:14:19.000 FCW:    you can copy the vb6 firecall folder to your PC
2021-07-02 20:14:03.000 FCW:    a click on that makes it appear with appropriate sounds
2021-07-02 20:13:48.000 FCW:    when I select an Emoji it will appear on the torn sheet of paper on the top of the extras area that you can probably see on one of the recent attachments I sent you
2021-07-02 20:12:58.000 FCW:    When you select an emoji - it appears on the telly
2021-07-02 19:06:30.000 FCW:    sunny but air not hot
2021-07-02 19:06:22.000 FCW:    cool here

2021-07-02 18:40:40.000 FCW:    lots to cook for this eve
2021-07-02 18:40:29.000 FCW:    tomatoes, cucumber, chopped lettuce and fried peas
2021-07-02 18:40:08.000 FCW:    spicy sauce again
2021-07-02 18:40:02.000 FCW:    pork belly with noodles this time
2021-07-02 18:39:50.000 FCW:    same as the other day here
2021-07-02 18:36:38.000 FCW:    that is my backup folder
2021-07-02 18:36:27.000 FCW:    should be everything you need
2021-07-02 18:36:15.000 FCW:    resources/images
2021-07-02 18:36:09.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 18:36:08.000 FCW:    you will see a fire call folder
2021-07-02 18:35:59.000 FCW:    there
2021-07-02 18:35:57.000 FCW:    in their
2021-07-02 18:35:54.000 FCW:    can you see a vb6 folder?
2021-07-02 18:35:47.000 FCW:    look on dropbox
2021-07-02 16:59:01.000 FCW:    strimmer!
2021-07-02 16:58:53.000 FCW:    Weeding the garden, it is decent enough day for it.
2021-07-02 16:58:47.000 FCW:    sensible or not
2021-07-02 16:58:38.000 FCW:    this version handles it
2021-07-02 16:58:31.000 FCW:    understood
2021-07-02 16:15:59.000 FCW:    still not as good as the SD documentation but getting there
2021-07-02 16:15:44.000 FCW:    it has been updated
2021-07-02 16:15:39.000 FCW:    in that folder
2021-07-02 16:15:35.000 FCW:    have a look at the file FireCallWin Help.html
2021-07-02 16:14:41.000 FCW:    does it say new folder:?
2021-07-02 16:14:23.000 FCW:    is there any indication that it is a folder?
2021-07-02 16:14:09.000 FCW:    when you upload a folder just as I have done
2021-07-02 16:13:38.000 FCW:    <><>help
2021-07-02 16:13:29.000 FCW:    much like that
2021-07-02 16:13:24.000 FCW:    I see it
2021-07-02 15:41:02.000 FCW:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2021-07-02 15:29:37.000 FCW:    When you are done, I may do that to completet the picture
2021-07-02 15:29:25.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 15:20:13.000 FCW:    Back shortly, I'm off out.
2021-07-02 15:20:06.000 FCW:    The stuff on the right is largely all optional
2021-07-02 15:19:29.000 FCW:    so it would take up a similar amount of space as the JS version
2021-07-02 15:19:11.000 FCW:    just retaining the two text areas, bottom buttons &c
2021-07-02 15:18:38.000 FCW:    I had planned a small "roll up" button that would minimise screen usage and remove the right hand side button column, fire button, lid, the lot
2021-07-02 15:17:44.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 15:17:13.000 FCW:    understood re: awake
2021-07-02 15:14:03.000 FCW:    and I could create a .KON file from Photoshop that would have all the latest elements in place and ready to go
2021-07-02 15:13:30.000 FCW:     do you fancy creating the same skin in .JS? you have the essential graphical elements
2021-07-02 15:12:52.000 FCW:    and it fits my desktop
2021-07-02 15:12:35.000 FCW:    I am really enjoying uisng it
2021-07-02 15:12:27.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 15:12:13.000 FCW:    then you can have it
2021-07-02 15:12:09.000 FCW:    the PNG images too
2021-07-02 15:11:57.000 FCW:    and the remaining ping, response and Awake functionality
2021-07-02 15:11:33.000 FCW:    I want to get the quicksort in place before I hand you the binary
2021-07-02 15:11:02.000 FCW:    but as the only user is me...
2021-07-02 15:10:54.000 FCW:    so the user can probably still crash it
2021-07-02 15:10:22.000 FCW:    I have not yet added the 10 variants limitation in the prefs yet
2021-07-02 15:09:58.000 FCW:    My version is working quite well at the moment
2021-07-02 15:09:29.000 FCW:    I'd have done the same but the prefs was a better place for it in the VB6 version
2021-07-02 15:09:07.000 FCW:    c
2021-07-02 15:09:05.000 FCW:    it is a sensible option to have an edit funtion attached to each button
2021-07-02 15:08:38.000 FCW:    re: the predefined buttons
2021-07-02 15:08:24.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 15:08:09.000 FCW:    I'd like to show you the code and allwo you to dig into it (no coding required) but you'd need the VB6 IDE
2021-07-02 15:07:04.000 FCW:    I intend to add a ping response as you describe
2021-07-02 15:06:42.000 FCW:    back to FC
2021-07-02 15:06:39.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 15:06:37.000 FCW:    but not yet...
2021-07-02 15:06:30.000 FCW:    I am strongly thinking about writing such a tool and my first thoughts as to the logic exists for it
2021-07-02 15:06:00.000 FCW:    as I can do in the VB6 form of the thing
2021-07-02 15:05:49.000 FCW:    then you could add more buttons and place elements as you wish
2021-07-02 15:05:27.000 FCW:    re:  Prefs tool - I think that being able to add more to a customisable prefs would be a useful feature
2021-07-02 15:04:51.000 FCW:    sorry
2021-07-02 15:04:39.000 FCW:    I intend to send a Ping response
2021-07-02 14:54:06.000 FCW:    on the creation of a prefs tool
2021-07-02 14:53:56.000 FCW:    changing the subject slightly
2021-07-02 14:53:47.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 14:53:29.000 FCW:    hope that makes sense
2021-07-02 14:52:43.000 FCW:    or rather the VB6 way
2021-07-02 14:52:33.000 FCW:    and the satisfaction of doing it my own way
2021-07-02 14:52:21.000 FCW:    slightly more fun this way
2021-07-02 14:49:18.000 FCW:    and then afterwards see the differences once I have implemented it
2021-07-02 14:48:58.000 FCW:    trying not to view pre-existing code
2021-07-02 14:48:48.000 FCW:    I know I could dive into the .js code but I prefer to do it the VB6 way using a simple requirement and then replicate that
2021-07-02 14:48:20.000 FCW:    Could you describe what it does, if anything other than just a ping?
2021-07-02 14:47:41.000 FCW:    The Ping logic in FC
2021-07-02 14:47:32.000 FCW:    Q. for you
2021-07-02 14:47:29.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 14:47:15.000 FCW:    then wash her hands...
2021-07-02 14:47:06.000 FCW:    a battle to make her let go
2021-07-02 14:46:55.000 FCW:    just had a fight with my mum in the garden, she was trying, and insisting on eating toadstools
2021-07-02 11:57:12.000 FCW:    Just going out for a while, back later!
2021-07-02 11:55:41.000 FCW:    and typos
2021-07-02 11:55:38.000 FCW:    'scuse grammar
2021-07-02 11:55:26.000 FCW:    but I know you love your JSON
2021-07-02 11:55:10.000 FCW:    and if you had the same it would migration of your settings easier
2021-07-02 11:54:51.000 FCW:    so the code is off the shelf
2021-07-02 11:54:29.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 11:54:26.000 FCW:    I use the same code to read and write the settings.ini as I use for SD
2021-07-02 11:53:46.000 FCW:    button1message1 is how I save the listbox values
2021-07-02 11:53:15.000 FCW:    <><>settings.ini
2021-07-02 11:52:46.000 FCW:    I will send you the contents
2021-07-02 11:52:39.000 FCW:    but instead of a JSON (which to my mind is too complicated for my needs) I write to  a settings .ini file
2021-07-02 11:52:09.000 FCW:    That is what I am doing for all the prefs
2021-07-02 11:52:00.000 FCW:    your saving of the prefs makes sense
2021-07-02 11:51:45.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 11:51:27.000 FCW:    there is a redim preserve statement that grows an array if required and preseves the contents
2021-07-02 11:50:54.000 FCW:    but that can be changed dynamically
2021-07-02 11:50:41.000 FCW:    at the moment it is set at 10
2021-07-02 11:50:23.000 FCW:    I can now add custom predefined texts to all buttons
2021-07-02 11:50:02.000 FCW:    All working!
2021-07-02 11:49:58.000 FCW:    testing done

2021-07-02 11:49:45.000 FCW:    Coding continues, making progress, step by step... anything doing your end?
2021-07-02 11:49:44.000 FCW:    So much to do at the moment, hard to find time for anything else.

2021-07-02 11:49:40.000 FCW:    Weeding the garden, it is decent enough day for it.
2021-07-02 11:49:40.000 FCW:    Tidying up the garden ready for our next set of visitors.
2021-07-02 11:49:38.000 FCW:    Coding continues apace, step by step it progresses.
2021-07-02 11:49:37.000 FCW:    Doing a bit of programming today...
2021-07-02 11:49:36.000 FCW:    I'm having a coding day, making progress

2021-07-02 11:49:31.000 FCW:    Done anything interesting worth telling?

2021-07-02 11:49:14.000 FCW:    A bit of testing... pre-defined buttons reading the values dynamically
2021-07-02 11:26:48.000 FCW:    Ta Ta For Now!
2021-07-02 11:26:46.000 FCW:

2021-07-02 11:09:59.000 FCW:    minor changes
2021-07-02 11:09:47.000 FCW:    testing text input
2021-07-02 11:06:11.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 11:06:01.000 FCW:    testing
2021-07-02 11:05:53.000 FCW:    Type your text here...
2021-07-02 11:03:30.000 FCW:    annoying dog
2021-07-02 11:03:25.000 FCW:    now a half-set PVA puddle that needs to be soaked and removed by hand
2021-07-02 11:02:58.000 FCW:    she turned my acid-free PVA (expensive) pot on its side causing it to leak even though the lid was firmly on
2021-07-02 11:02:19.000 FCW:    decided to curl up on the spot where I was working, as she likes to be near me
2021-07-02 11:01:58.000 FCW:    bloody animal (dog) made a mess of my study carpet
2021-07-02 11:01:43.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 11:01:37.000 FCW:    If you decide to do the same on YWE using the prefs then I'd be interested to see how you do it
2021-07-02 10:49:38.000 FCW:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2021-07-02 10:49:32.000 FCW:    Ta Ta For Now!
2021-07-02 10:42:05.000 FCW:    we'll see which is best suited
2021-07-02 10:41:56.000 FCW:    so it can be used by both forms
2021-07-02 10:41:36.000 FCW:    I will simply duplicate the code to read the same data  on the main form startup or make that code public
2021-07-02 10:36:19.000 FCW:    or have a think...
2021-07-02 10:36:13.000 FCW:    I may have to limit the number of texts that can be added to say 10
2021-07-02 10:35:53.000 FCW:    VB6 does not allow that
2021-07-02 10:35:41.000 FCW:    and I cannot simply store the values in global variables because they would have to be created dynamically
2021-07-02 10:35:09.000 FCW:    pulling those sliders into the startup of the form means Show-ing the Prefs form prematurely before it is ready
2021-07-02 10:34:04.000 FCW:    
2021-07-02 10:33:59.000 FCW:    and that, strangely is more complicated than you'd think as the loading and saving of the values is currently entirely within the Prefs form that is not exposed when the program starts
2021-07-02 10:33:04.000 FCW:    I have not yet modified the buttons to use the values
2021-07-02 10:31:47.000 FCW:    it saves to file and reads same on startup successfully
2021-07-02 10:31:21.000 FCW:    FCW successfully allows modification and addition to/subtraction from the pre-defined text lists
2021-07-02 10:30:32.000 FCW:    expected that
2021-07-02 10:30:27.000 FCW:    understood
2021-07-02 09:46:58.000 FCW:    back again
2021-07-02 09:17:35.000 FCW:    shutting down and restarting
2021-07-02 09:16:35.000 FCW:    morning

2021-07-01 20:24:24.000 FCW:    you told me about that
2021-07-01 20:12:08.000 FCW:    river is no longer navigable
2021-07-01 20:11:56.000 FCW:    not since 1911
2021-07-01 20:11:43.000 FCW:    but there used to be once upon a time
2021-07-01 20:11:32.000 FCW:    no canal boats here now

2021-07-01 20:05:53.000 FCW:    made a spicy sauce with the meat juices, chinese five spice, chilli flakes, chopped tomatoes and a dab of cream
2021-07-01 20:04:54.000 FCW:    still drizzle
2021-07-01 16:57:28.000 FCW:    all day drizzle

2021-06-30 23:35:56.000 Fire Call Win:    FCW does not have an awake timer
2021-06-30 23:35:36.000 Fire Call Win:    I'll need to add a new prefs tab to handle the predefined text responses
2021-06-30 23:33:59.000 Fire Call Win:    I have not yet added PNG support (a biggie)
2021-06-30 23:33:42.000 Fire Call Win:    I am also adding customisation of the text responses in the pre-defined buttons

2021-06-30 23:30:46.000 Fire Call Win:    is that the sort of thing that might interest you? what would you pay for that?
2021-06-30 23:30:25.000 Fire Call Win:    
2021-06-30 23:30:24.000 Fire Call Win:    it might be a possible design that would be a lot more expensive than a standard vice but could still be made and sold at a price an enthusiast would be willing to pay
2021-06-30 23:29:23.000 Fire Call Win:    but nowadays, with water cutting and machine milling
2021-06-30 23:29:06.000 Fire Call Win:    that vice, I would have thought it would have been prohibitively expensive when designed in 1912 , I think it was
2021-06-30 23:28:14.000 Fire Call Win:    
2021-06-30 23:27:52.000 Fire Call Win:    just a thought...
2021-06-30 23:27:43.000 Fire Call Win:    
2021-06-30 23:27:25.000 Fire Call Win:    especailly if it usable on both language variants
2021-06-30 23:27:06.000 Fire Call Win:    but it would be an interesting project
2021-06-30 23:26:52.000 Fire Call Win:    I know you don't want to pick up a new language
2021-06-30 23:26:35.000 Fire Call Win:    
2021-06-30 23:25:49.000 Fire Call Win:    and I have a few projects to complete before I do this
2021-06-30 23:25:23.000 Fire Call Win:    It is not a trivial task
2021-06-30 23:24:49.000 Fire Call Win:    this will work especially if I use only functioanlity that is aavailable to both languages
2021-06-30 23:24:25.000 Fire Call Win:    then I could port it back to VB6 so I can use it for both languages
2021-06-30 23:24:04.000 Fire Call Win:    and usign VB.NET might make more sense
2021-06-30 23:23:52.000 Fire Call Win:    and so the work would be better spent on a current language
2021-06-30 23:23:30.000 Fire Call Win:    I don't think there is much point in creating one for YWE these days
2021-06-30 23:22:52.000 Fire Call Win:    I am analysing what needs to be done to create a VB program (VB6/NET) to read an XML file from YWE and create a preferences app within VB6/VB.NET

2021-06-30 22:30:27.907 JS Fire Call:    there is an animation

2021-06-30 10:20:03.000 Fire Call Win:    I will find a way
2021-06-30 09:44:08.000 Fire Call Win:    that's useful
2021-06-30 09:44:03.000 Fire Call Win:    OK
2021-06-30 09:18:41.000 Fire Call Win:    I have seen such a thing
2021-06-30 09:18:32.000 Fire Call Win:    agreed
2021-06-30 09:12:57.000 Fire Call Win:    It should be possible in VB6 though I am unaware of any built in sort routine
2021-06-30 08:57:36.000 Fire Call Win:    we shall see
2021-06-30 08:57:32.000 Fire Call Win:    or slower to achieve in VB6 code
2021-06-30 08:57:15.000 Fire Call Win:    as I think it will be more complicated than I expect!
2021-06-30 08:56:58.000 Fire Call Win:    when all is done
2021-06-30 08:56:52.000 Fire Call Win:    I will provide the option to merge into one

2021-06-30 08:56:06.000 Fire Call Win:    I find is actually quite helpful

2021-06-29 16:04:24.000 Fire Call Win:    do you fancy recording your shredder in operation?
2021-06-29 16:03:49.000 Fire Call Win:    I think I will cause an automatic reprint whenever the emoji changes
2021-06-29 16:03:26.000 Fire Call Win:    once printed
2021-06-29 16:03:18.000 Fire Call Win:    and at the moment the image just changes
2021-06-29 16:02:55.000 Fire Call Win:    it requires a click on a small strip that represents the printer roll before it starts to print
2021-06-29 16:02:22.000 Fire Call Win:    works perfectly
2021-06-29 16:01:47.000 Fire Call Win:    send an emoiji please

2021-06-29 16:00:59.000 Fire Call Win:    in the usual printer/shredding manner
2021-06-29 16:00:43.000 Fire Call Win:    when it is at the bottom a click shreds it
2021-06-29 16:00:29.000 Fire Call Win:    when you click on it, it drops to the bottom
2021-06-29 16:00:15.000 Fire Call Win:    and it assigns that to a picbox that is 'printed', falling to the bottom of the box when done
2021-06-29 15:59:40.000 Fire Call Win:    at the moment it only recognises the last emoji sent, assuming that is the current status
2021-06-29 15:59:08.000 Fire Call Win:    I have the emoji printer working

2021-06-29 13:16:09.143 JS Fire Call:    the image was marked as missing in .js FC
2021-06-29 13:15:04.000 Fire Call Win:    and add PNG support later
2021-06-29 13:14:54.000 Fire Call Win:    so I will have a placeholder image for those
2021-06-29 13:14:44.000 Fire Call Win:    the trouble is I cannot easily display a PNG
2021-06-29 13:14:26.000 Fire Call Win:    your photos/images will appear as print-outs too
2021-06-29 13:14:06.000 Fire Call Win:    whilst mine appears on the 'screen'
2021-06-29 13:12:58.000 Fire Call Win:    I am making changes so that your emoji appears as a print out in the 'printer'

2021-06-29 10:41:47.000 Fire Call Win:    and then test
2021-06-29 10:41:43.000 Fire Call Win:    I wil amend the code so that the .jpg part is removed
2021-06-29 10:41:13.000 Fire Call Win:
2021-06-29 10:41:10.000 Fire Call Win:    so that users except the other changes
2021-06-29 10:40:57.000 Fire Call Win:    it is possibly giving the world something to complain about... that they can remove later
2021-06-29 10:40:36.000 Fire Call Win:    and as I suspected they will have to back track on it
2021-06-29 10:40:17.000 Fire Call Win:    so it is still an arbitrary cut off point
2021-06-29 10:40:01.000 Fire Call Win:    as all such machines can run win 10 well
2021-06-29 10:39:40.000 Fire Call Win:    the decision probably opens the doors to a lot more testing that they may have to do  but little more
2021-06-29 10:39:08.000 Fire Call Win:    and still be able to not do it at their whim
2021-06-29 10:38:49.000 Fire Call Win:    to placate the furore
2021-06-29 10:38:30.000 Fire Call Win:    What MS has done is lowered the bar to 'possibly' include 7th gen machines
2021-06-29 10:38:01.000 Fire Call Win:    so, your recent machine was excluded
2021-06-29 10:37:48.000 Fire Call Win:    I thought it had encompassed 7th gen but I was wrong, it was inclusive of 8th gen upward
2021-06-29 10:36:53.000 Fire Call Win:    one level
2021-06-29 10:36:48.000 Fire Call Win:    The MS hardware limitation has just been dropped
2021-06-29 10:36:15.000 Fire Call Win:    ignoring

2021-06-28 23:41:41.000 Fire Call Win:    and then we can figure it out locally according to the name
2021-06-28 23:41:21.000 Fire Call Win:    or strip the suffix altogether
2021-06-28 23:41:13.000 Fire Call Win:    you send PNGs
2021-06-28 23:41:07.000 Fire Call Win:    I will send jpgs
2021-06-28 23:41:01.000 Fire Call Win:    in this case jpg
2021-06-28 23:40:55.000 Fire Call Win:    and then append the local suffix
2021-06-28 23:40:35.000 Fire Call Win:    so we will have to strip off the suffix

2021-06-28 23:31:14.000 Fire Call Win:   so I can change that manually if it does not work as expected
2021-06-28 23:30:53.000 Fire Call Win:   it adds a vbCrLf to the end of each line
2021-06-28 23:30:36.000 Fire Call Win:   changed the method of writing to a hopefully more unix friendly method
2021-06-28 23:29:52.000 Fire Call Win:   and this?

2021-06-28 22:32:51.063 JS Fire Call:    supposedly it is using a vbCrLf
2021-06-28 22:31:26.655 JS Fire Call:    I will look at using an o/s API to do the same that preserves the CRLF for unix
2021-06-28 22:30:44.630 JS Fire Call:    it is a basic output method
2021-06-28 22:30:33.839 JS Fire Call:    I will research it
2021-06-28 22:30:17.693 JS Fire Call:    I am using a particular vb6 function to write each line to the output file
2021-06-28 22:27:04.100 JS Fire Call:    I'll look at the writing of the output again
2021-06-28 22:08:55.155 JS Fire Call:    will correct the spaces to 4
2021-06-28 21:38:15.000 Fire Call Win:   in a way that you will appreciate I think

2021-06-19 21:22:40.166 JS Fire Call:    the ignoring mouse is not a sensible thing to do in Windows
2021-06-19 21:22:13.364 JS Fire Call:    so it is possible but very dirty
2021-06-19 21:22:02.546 JS Fire Call:    it could be done with subclassing but it is a method that you want to avod until the program is complete as it will kill the IDE when that code is included

2021-06-18 09:55:10.608 JS Fire Call:    strange
2021-06-18 09:55:05.636 JS Fire Call:    then back to the old routine of not sleeping
2021-06-18 09:54:56.474 JS Fire Call:    then sleep like a log
2021-06-18 09:54:51.228 JS Fire Call:    like that for three/four nights
2021-06-18 09:54:43.845 JS Fire Call:    waking all night
2021-06-18 09:54:40.699 JS Fire Call:    bed late, up early
2021-06-18 09:54:32.214 JS Fire Call:    sleeping v. badly
2021-06-18 09:54:27.160 JS Fire Call:    morning
2021-06-17 23:52:06.663 JS Fire Call:    goodnight!
2021-06-17 21:30:19.145 JS Fire Call:    once again using Windows APIs
2021-06-17 21:30:12.812 JS Fire Call:    but it is an interesting effect and could have uses
2021-06-17 21:29:58.221 JS Fire Call:    Does not help much with the core problem of VB6 not being able to process transparent images
2021-06-17 21:29:34.982 JS Fire Call:    I have also discovered ways of making solid controls transparent too
2021-06-17 21:29:05.362 JS Fire Call:    but it shows it can be done
2021-06-17 21:28:47.097 JS Fire Call:    very strange to see a VB6 program with transparency
2021-06-17 21:28:30.036 JS Fire Call:    Shows FCW on the desktop with 50% transparency
2021-06-17 21:27:53.757 JS Fire Call:    <><>FCWTransparent01.png
2021-06-17 18:41:26.673 JS Fire Call:    same here
2021-06-17 18:35:40.413 JS Fire Call:    as well as layering top/bottom but  I need to test that
2021-06-17 18:35:17.883 JS Fire Call:    transparency implemented as per the Window tab in the prefs of any widget
2021-06-17 18:34:53.374 JS Fire Call:    I assumed you had done it but wasn't sure
2021-06-17 13:25:10.360 JS Fire Call:    excuse typos
2021-06-17 13:25:00.935 JS Fire Call:    the timer also checks whther the user has been idle for the timet interval so it eliminates those occasions where FC minimises when you are just looking at the information
2021-06-17 13:24:03.140 JS Fire Call:    FCW I have added a minimise to stamp on a timer
2021-06-17 13:23:46.490 JS Fire Call:
2021-06-17 13:23:29.529 JS Fire Call:    windows updates at the moment are fraught with worry
2021-06-17 13:23:18.230 JS Fire Call:
2021-06-17 13:23:13.517 JS Fire Call:    intersting about steamyDock
2021-06-16 20:08:26.768 JS Fire Call:    update to which version?
2021-06-16 17:23:57.991 JS Fire Call:    Ping response. Refresh Interval: 900 OS: Windows Version: 1.6
2021-06-16 17:13:58.746 JS Fire Call:    righto
2021-06-16 16:48:06.232 JS Fire Call:    but if you have a job that creates a lot of temporary files withthe same name you can quickly run out
2021-06-16 16:47:27.663 JS Fire Call:    it means you can recover any past edit
2021-06-16 16:47:11.110 JS Fire Call:    where n = 1 - 32768
2021-06-16 16:47:02.669 JS Fire Call:    so each modification of a file results in a filename.suf.n
2021-06-16 16:46:40.675 JS Fire Call:    on VMS 32bit The file system is versioned
2021-06-16 16:46:12.232 JS Fire Call:    that's it
2021-06-16 16:46:08.916 JS Fire Call:    and at the end it just won't try  and populate
2021-06-16 16:45:44.537 JS Fire Call:    it simply states you are nearing the end.... at 32700
2021-06-16 16:45:27.130 JS Fire Call:    I still have to have some code to deal with it
2021-06-16 16:45:14.501 JS Fire Call:    it is the line limit
2021-06-16 11:58:14.946 JS Fire Call:    the oldest data will not be displayed
2021-06-16 11:58:01.175 JS Fire Call:    so I have no choice but to limit the amount of lines in a file to less than that
2021-06-16 11:57:32.025 JS Fire Call:    max. value 32768 - 2
2021-06-16 11:57:16.669 JS Fire Call:    the size is defined using an integer
2021-06-16 11:57:01.831 JS Fire Call:    Have a small problem with the listboxes I have chosen to hold the data
2021-06-16 11:56:40.282 JS Fire Call:
2021-06-16 11:56:36.280 JS Fire Call:    understood
2021-06-16 09:27:58.862 JS Fire Call:    crisis endured
2021-06-16 09:27:51.954 JS Fire Call:    and didn't hear them fall
2021-06-16 09:27:36.083 JS Fire Call:    She dropped them as she got out!
2021-06-16 09:27:21.444 JS Fire Call:    found right by her car
2021-06-16 09:27:14.654 JS Fire Call:    and in the end I made her search alongside me, all the garden and verges
2021-06-16 09:26:56.373 JS Fire Call:    we had tears for three hours
2021-06-16 09:26:47.495 JS Fire Call:
2021-06-16 09:26:46.907 JS Fire Call:    told her always to put them on the hook - ignored me
2021-06-16 09:26:33.253 JS Fire Call:    told her to put them on a big key ring so they clonk when dropped, ignored me
2021-06-16 09:26:15.664 JS Fire Call:    ignored me
2021-06-16 09:26:09.185 JS Fire Call:    she only has one set - I told her to get another set cut
2021-06-16 09:25:55.421 JS Fire Call:    only just left for school
2021-06-16 09:25:48.841 JS Fire Call:    Lucy lost here keys this am

2021-06-15 21:46:33.474 JS Fire Call:    I need to investigate
2021-06-15 21:46:22.098 JS Fire Call:    it has one lf in it but that is where you'd expect at the EOL
2021-06-15 21:46:03.669 JS Fire Call:    trying to find out if the string is somehow normalised as it hits the textbox
2021-06-15 21:45:34.908 JS Fire Call:    and it finds none of those
2021-06-15 21:45:23.031 JS Fire Call:    I search for cr lf VbCr VbCrLf "\n" and "\r\n"
2021-06-15 21:44:41.564 JS Fire Call:    that line won't split for me

2021-06-15 17:25:52.860 JS Fire Call:    What's happening, anything interesting?
2021-06-15 17:25:49.000 JS Fire Call:    Any news, how's life?
2021-06-15 17:25:45.476 JS Fire Call:    Very busy at the moment. Lots to do.
2021-06-15 17:25:41.266 JS Fire Call:    Weather any good today?
2021-06-15 17:06:30.350 JS Fire Call:
2021-06-15 17:06:27.832 JS Fire Call:    So, we will be able to see your and my emojis at the same time, yours in printer format and mine on telly
2021-06-15 17:05:36.475 JS Fire Call:    when you send one, that emoji picbox will drop down and fall onto the bottom of the speaker box with a bounce
2021-06-15 17:05:05.907 JS Fire Call:    the piece or white above is the print-out of your emoji
2021-06-15 17:04:46.508 JS Fire Call:
2021-06-15 17:04:46.234 JS Fire Call:
2021-06-15 17:04:44.876 JS Fire Call:    and they look the part
2021-06-15 17:04:40.263 JS Fire Call:    then I can display those in the telly
2021-06-15 17:04:15.645 JS Fire Call:    takes a minute or so, no work
2021-06-15 17:04:07.504 JS Fire Call:    then I apply that macro to each of the emojis
2021-06-15 17:03:56.097 JS Fire Call:    instead I open all the emojis in Photoshop, record a macro of actions to make one emoji look how I want it to
2021-06-15 17:03:21.079 JS Fire Call:    so I can't put an image in front of an emoji and expect that to work as a 'filter'
2021-06-15 17:02:57.367 JS Fire Call:    VB6 has no transparency
2021-06-15 17:02:46.366 JS Fire Call:    top left resized to fit and bottom left, well...
2021-06-15 17:02:25.576 JS Fire Call:    That shows the reading of the emojis top left and bottom right

2021-06-15 10:05:10.071 JS Fire Call:    now dealing with the emojis
2021-06-15 10:04:25.148 JS Fire Call:    new icons on the prefs
2021-06-15 10:04:07.265 JS Fire Call:    scrollbars are made visible/invisible
2021-06-15 10:03:23.616 JS Fire Call:    FCW minimises to a small icon on the desktop as per FC
2021-06-15 10:02:47.371 JS Fire Call:    it copies the output to filename.suffix+ ".n" where n is an incrementing number
2021-06-15 10:02:02.642 JS Fire Call:    implemented backups on FCW, properly this time - and tested
2021-06-15 10:01:36.191 JS Fire Call:    understood
2021-06-14 23:24:22.396 JS Fire Call:    I've been busy!
