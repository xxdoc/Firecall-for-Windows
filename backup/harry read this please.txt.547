2021-09-12 11:15:48.860 Dean:    but it does mean that  the browser may become more of a desktop in the end
2021-09-12 11:15:25.120 Dean:    I can see that returning to the bad old days of waiting for a program to download and run

2021-09-12 11:14:25.680 Dean:    so, as well as just-in-time .js you can deliver compiled code to the browser
2021-09-12 11:13:48.700 Dean:    as long as the compiler for that language exists

2021-09-07 13:52:53.010 Dean:    
2021-09-07 13:44:38.480 Dean:    So, a lot learnt over the last two days
2021-09-07 13:44:22.370 Dean:    
2021-09-07 13:44:20.830 Dean:    but as they are multi-threaded they cannot operate in the VB6 IDE which is strictly single threading
2021-09-07 13:43:53.370 Dean:    the WINAPI timers don't have that limitation
2021-09-07 13:43:36.240 Dean:    and means that timers always have to be referenced by their parent form
2021-09-07 13:43:19.540 Dean:    ecific form too, which is architectural issue
2021-09-07 13:43:19.510 Dean:    VB6 have limitations as described above as well as only having a max delay time of 32768ms and they are attached to a sp
2021-09-07 13:42:22.520 Dean:    so you achieve higher priority timers, multithreading and timers that can operate without a VB6 timer object
2021-09-07 13:41:40.360 Dean:    that uses COM to initiate your callback function in its own thread
2021-09-07 13:41:01.590 Dean:    you can get around this by using a WINAPI timer to act as a VB timer then assign a callback function to the WINAPI call
2021-09-07 13:40:01.930 Dean:    
2021-09-07 13:40:00.300 Dean:    so VB6 timers have in effect low priority
2021-09-07 13:39:43.040 Dean:    ing on in the main UI
2021-09-07 13:39:43.020 Dean:    the timers not running in their own thread are subservient to the main UI that can swamp a timer if there is too much go
2021-09-07 13:39:03.640 Dean:    I have to research this further
2021-09-07 13:38:50.070 Dean:    VB6 timers run semi-asynch but not in their own thread as VB6 is  a single threading app
2021-09-07 13:38:12.590 Dean:    in fact today I learned a few things
2021-09-07 13:38:03.650 Dean:    
2021-09-07 13:38:02.670 Dean:    rn
2021-09-07 13:38:01.220 Dean:    and I have leanrt something new
2021-09-07 13:37:54.160 Dean:    and so message queueing is working!
2021-09-07 13:37:17.300 Dean:    and the timer runs until the collection count = 0
2021-09-07 13:36:54.640 Dean:    &c
2021-09-07 13:36:46.870 Dean:    the second in the collection becomes the first
2021-09-07 13:36:36.490 Dean:    I read the first in the collection and then delete it
2021-09-07 13:36:23.550 Dean:    and it increments the index automatically
2021-09-07 13:36:11.760 Dean:    So, I have a VB6 collection that I simply .add to
2021-09-07 13:35:50.450 Dean:    there are times when I need to send a message asynchronously and with a delay to ensure current processing is complete
2021-09-07 13:35:16.430 Dean:    however
2021-09-07 13:35:12.750 Dean:    When I need to send a message synchronously I just do it
2021-09-07 13:34:45.120 Dean:    checking the message queuing
2021-09-07 13:34:33.000 Dean:    Each of those is a test

2021-09-06 19:16:14.050 Dean:    I am just fettling FCW for you to test
2021-09-06 15:38:32.500 Dean:    a long time ago
2021-09-06 15:38:27.480 Dean:    We had something similar happen before
2021-09-06 15:38:02.390 Dean:    as something may be being aggressively cached
2021-09-06 15:37:32.160 Dean:    You might have to write the values to a file
2021-09-06 14:41:30.130 Dean:    I just need to prove that on two other systems
2021-09-06 14:41:16.370 Dean:    FCW
2021-09-06 14:41:12.720 Dean:    fire call is working on other systems
2021-09-06 13:28:22.970 Dean:    Finding out where the problem is?
2021-09-06 12:11:19.400 Dean:    
2021-09-06 12:11:00.110 Dean:    though  .js should handle that seamlessly
2021-09-06 12:10:26.000 Dean:    the 13 chars could be a problem
2021-09-06 12:10:16.280 Dean:    Windows may have a problem with comparing the timestamp as a LONG
2021-09-06 12:09:51.010 Dean:    so, you are doing it correctly
2021-09-06 12:05:22.080 Dean:    so I may have something for you to test soon
2021-09-06 12:05:10.980 Dean:    However, I think I have it cracked
2021-09-06 11:54:43.560 Dean:    for applications
2021-09-06 11:54:38.670 Dean:    requires access to the system event viewer
2021-09-06 11:54:21.020 Dean:    and errors are difficult to spot and resolve

2021-09-06 11:53:56.550 Dean:    Creating a manifest is not easy
2021-09-06 11:16:50.520 Dean:    I am also creating a manifest for firecallwin and testing it on other systems
2021-09-06 11:16:35.170 Dean:    
2021-09-06 09:47:48.930 Dean:    Is it testing the timestamp values?
2021-09-06 09:47:40.380 Dean:    how does FC js do its checking?
2021-09-06 09:47:18.510 Dean:    strange
2021-09-06 09:46:22.370 Dean:    
2021-09-06 09:46:13.320 Dean:    Cannot find my breadboard
2021-09-06 09:46:04.820 Dean:    I am still building my circuit as I can't find the parts
2021-09-06 09:45:45.600 Dean:    we'll see how that goes
2021-09-06 09:45:26.690 Dean:    f
2021-09-06 09:45:23.730 Dean:    I am going to try to implement my message queue modigication today
2021-09-06 09:40:27.850 Dean:    earlier than me
2021-09-06 09:40:21.310 Dean:    I see you were at 08:11
2021-09-06 09:40:03.430 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2021-09-06 09:40:01.090 Dean:    
2021-09-06 09:39:51.410 Dean:    I think that makes more sense in the context of a chat program
2021-09-06 09:39:06.070 Dean:    it also only  responds to the last one sent
2021-09-06 09:38:54.540 Dean:    that hasn't been switched on for a while
2021-09-06 09:38:43.420 Dean:    but that doesn't help if the machine is a new machine
2021-09-06 09:38:28.670 Dean:    and only responds if it is a new one
2021-09-06 09:38:14.430 Dean:    FCW records the data/time of the last one sent
2021-09-06 09:37:31.460 Dean:    I think you need to add a timeout to ping and awake requests
2021-09-06 09:37:12.800 Dean:    Looks like your Windows system is catching up
2021-09-06 09:34:19.680 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1189
2021-09-06 09:23:51.430 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1189

2021-09-05 16:20:24.210 Dean:    and a good way to ensure no loss
2021-09-05 16:20:13.360 Dean:    looks suitably equipped with holes
2021-09-05 16:19:47.350 Dean:    then it sorted itself out showing the image
2021-09-05 16:19:34.350 Dean:    so it handled it as an "unknown" for a second or two
2021-09-05 16:19:17.720 Dean:    but the reference was in the text
2021-09-05 16:19:08.700 Dean:    the image was not yet here
2021-09-05 16:19:00.530 Dean:    FCW handled that correctly
2021-09-05 16:15:14.020 Dean:    
2021-09-05 16:15:03.890 Dean:    and I introduced a bug, now fixed
2021-09-05 16:14:43.280 Dean:    but I am removing it step by step
2021-09-05 16:14:30.140 Dean:    it may have been the root of that ANSI fault we experienced before
2021-09-05 16:14:05.690 Dean:    thoguh to generally works
2021-09-05 16:13:59.390 Dean:    and according to VB6ers, not recommended
2021-09-05 16:13:45.490 Dean:    it is heavy on memory
2021-09-05 16:13:39.730 Dean:    dropped some code into FCW to reduce the usage of the FSO filesystemobject
2021-09-05 16:13:18.950 Dean:    
2021-09-05 16:13:07.700 Dean:    ok
2021-09-05 16:13:01.460 Dean:    but ol even when bought from the shops
2021-09-05 16:12:50.610 Dean:    lemon drizzle is best if homemade

2021-09-05 15:51:15.120 Dean:    I did it though
2021-09-05 15:50:20.880 Dean:    but the designer is acceptable
2021-09-05 15:50:00.260 Dean:    the editor is atrocious
2021-09-05 15:49:40.260 Dean:    annoying 
2021-09-05 15:49:25.690 Dean:    in code the syntax is  timer.setinterval = nnn
2021-09-05 15:48:36.240 Dean:    for example in the xwl file the timer has an "interval" set as a string
2021-09-05 15:48:01.720 Dean:    I had also forgotten hos inconsistent the syntax is
2021-09-05 15:47:34.590 Dean:    it is extremely tedious to use
2021-09-05 15:47:22.280 Dean:    had forgotten how rubbish the IDE is for coding
2021-09-05 15:46:29.920 Dean:    Just opened Xwidgets for the first time in years to add a keypress hide f12 and to hold the duration in a preference

2021-09-04 09:58:20.700 Dean:    Morning!
2021-09-03 10:44:40.220 Dean:    I might transplant it
2021-09-03 10:44:29.730 Dean:    which is not big
2021-09-03 10:44:19.010 Dean:    needs to be small enough to sit inside the transformer box

2021-09-03 10:33:48.250 Dean:    silly joke

2021-09-02 21:09:58.510 Dean:    for xwidget
2021-09-02 20:50:48.450 Dean:    I would be willing to learn Pascal/Delphi if the code were available
2021-09-02 20:50:21.420 Dean:    
2021-09-02 20:50:00.350 Dean:    and grew more and more expensive over time
2021-09-02 20:49:50.090 Dean:    it was too expensive a product for the hobbyist
2021-09-02 20:49:34.630 Dean:    I never tried the REALBASIC IDE
2021-09-02 20:49:09.200 Dean:    all MS later IDEs take their cue from VB6
2021-09-02 20:48:41.770 Dean:    the later version provide even more but of course they bloat over time
2021-09-02 20:48:16.230 Dean:    it is convenience taken to the max.
2021-09-02 20:48:04.770 Dean:    from VB
2021-09-02 20:47:59.880 Dean:    I fly with the IDE
2021-09-02 20:47:40.320 Dean:    botched
2021-09-02 20:47:36.700 Dean:    everything else he had done was bothced
2021-09-02 20:47:21.580 Dean:    as was the merging of the web tech to place the widgets on screen.
2021-09-02 20:46:48.040 Dean:    as I really do think the graphical compsoiting IDE side of the Xwidget engine was a tour de force
2021-09-02 20:46:10.460 Dean:    and incorporate a decent editor or allow it to work with an external editor such as RJTextEd
2021-09-02 20:45:41.110 Dean:    and make it work for the YWE
2021-09-02 20:45:23.530 Dean:    from that we could coerce that engine to accept YWE syntax and then the methods
2021-09-02 20:44:50.020 Dean:    Delphi
2021-09-02 20:44:45.790 Dean:    I wan the source code of Xwidgets really
2021-09-02 20:44:35.290 Dean:    couple that with an IDE and it would be a killer app
2021-09-02 20:44:14.850 Dean:    it is the mix of IDE, supported engine, full documentation and multi platform support
2021-09-02 20:43:39.050 Dean:    I already have RJTextEd and that's good enough as an editor
2021-09-02 20:43:20.050 Dean:    Well a decent enough IDE but I cannot compoze /create graphical widgets with it and so it is only good as an editor
2021-09-02 20:31:48.070 Dean:    It is mooted to support other languages later
2021-09-02 20:30:56.030 Dean:    http://mixlangz.com/
2021-09-02 20:30:29.940 Dean:    Maybe I need to give MixLangz a go
2021-09-02 20:29:59.160 Dean:    IF I had the IDE for .js and the rendering engine then I would revert to .js in a second
2021-09-02 20:29:22.550 Dean:    
2021-09-02 20:29:09.480 Dean:    but it still superior due its RAD IDE, compiled nature, Win API compatibility and wealth of documentation, example code
2021-09-02 20:28:13.990 Dean:    annoyed I have to revert to VB6
2021-09-02 20:27:39.420 Dean:    By choice I would have coded in that environment
2021-09-02 20:27:20.520 Dean:    
2021-09-02 20:27:12.430 Dean:    but with SD I ave reached and exceeded my level of competence
2021-09-02 20:26:55.640 Dean:    If I had the knowledge and the time I would tried to recreate that
2021-09-02 20:26:35.820 Dean:    
2021-09-02 20:26:33.920 Dean:    no CSS, no HTML
2021-09-02 20:26:24.660 Dean:    that allows precise rendering to the level that the YWE & xwidget engines achieve
2021-09-02 20:25:41.760 Dean:    
2021-09-02 20:25:38.200 Dean:    I still need, no desire to have a .js IDE and rendering engine that respects the YWE documenetaiton and methods
2021-09-02 20:25:01.200 Dean:    
2021-09-02 20:24:44.900 Dean:    not many people have a computing brain available at the other end of a one-to-one chat program
2021-09-02 20:23:57.820 Dean:    I am very lucky to have you helping me
2021-09-02 20:23:20.930 Dean:    so, the language?
2021-09-02 20:23:08.990 Dean:    WoW
2021-09-02 20:01:50.700 Dean:    worst Summer for years
2021-09-02 20:01:41.310 Dean:    Completely
2021-09-02 19:07:02.810 Dean:    nothing worse than an unknown leak onto things that can rot
2021-09-02 19:06:29.630 Dean:    good work!
2021-09-02 18:15:38.050 Dean:    already part done and being tested
2021-09-02 18:15:18.600 Dean:    It would seem that I will be implementing a collection as that is the least complex and flexible method
2021-09-02 16:43:25.460 Dean:    you might like this

2021-09-02 16:43:18.550 Dean:    
2021-09-02 16:43:17.540 Dean:    researching now
2021-09-02 16:43:13.620 Dean:    
2021-09-02 16:40:20.700 Dean:    and was unaware of them
2021-09-02 16:40:15.260 Dean:    I have not used a linked list before
2021-09-02 16:39:58.480 Dean:    an array, a collection or a linked list
2021-09-02 16:39:46.660 Dean:    I have three possibilities for the message queue
2021-09-02 12:00:07.070 Dean:    but I always forget to use that
2021-09-02 11:59:55.540 Dean:    there is a test code button that just runs it through the compiler but does not produce output
2021-09-02 11:59:16.110 Dean:    so a lot of increments
2021-09-02 11:59:09.840 Dean:    However I often compile just to check my code is valid
2021-09-02 11:58:44.850 Dean:    Each time I compile, it increments the minor version number
2021-09-02 11:38:23.870 Dean:    currently 0.0.1188
2021-09-02 11:37:54.090 Dean:    & WindowsVer & "  Version:" & App.Major & "." & App.Minor & "." & App.Revision
2021-09-02 11:37:54.070 Dean:    "Ping response. Refresh interval: " & FireCallPrefs.cmbRefreshInterval.ItemData(Val(FCWRefreshIntervalIndex)) & "  OS:" 
2021-09-02 11:37:38.560 Dean:    Just checked and FCW is reporting o/s and program version no.
2021-09-02 11:34:36.550 Dean:    but they are really for interprocess message queueing and possibly overkill for what I want to do
2021-09-02 11:34:11.520 Dean:    
2021-09-02 11:33:56.750 Dean:    there are some Windows queuing mechanisms and I have examples 
2021-09-02 11:33:27.960 Dean:    I have asked the chaps on the vbforum for other possible methods and they often return a response quickly.
2021-09-02 11:32:29.690 Dean:    and clear them when done
2021-09-02 11:32:22.080 Dean:    and pop messages onto the array
2021-09-02 11:31:53.940 Dean:    or some other construct
2021-09-02 11:31:35.470 Dean:    so I nee dot set up a an array for a message queue of up to five messages
2021-09-02 11:31:09.350 Dean:    of the other
2021-09-02 11:31:01.480 Dean:    the trouble is that two tags sent simultaneously, one overwrites the tag property
2021-09-02 11:30:23.900 Dean:    just a temporary kludegs whilst I determine a better method
2021-09-02 11:30:00.850 Dean:    other than a global variable
2021-09-02 11:29:51.310 Dean:    one of the few ways of passing a parameter to a timer
2021-09-02 11:29:34.320 Dean:    which is a kludge
2021-09-02 11:29:26.510 Dean:    I pass the par\m using the .tag property
2021-09-02 11:29:11.020 Dean:    it also checks that the main processing is done before sending any message
2021-09-02 11:28:47.800 Dean:    to handle after a short delay
2021-09-02 11:28:37.310 Dean:    so I pop the message to a timer
2021-09-02 11:28:27.270 Dean:    if I send a message during that time then the whole process can get confused
2021-09-02 11:27:49.720 Dean:    during that processing I read the tags and determine what to do with each type
2021-09-02 11:27:08.590 Dean:    in FCW when I read the input file, I write the array and then format the output and write that to the listbox
2021-09-02 11:26:22.040 Dean:

2021-09-02 09:47:10.000 Dean:    and send
2021-09-02 09:47:01.390 Dean:    and passing the text as a parameter to the timer to handle
2021-09-02 09:46:30.050 Dean:    that is because I am using a timer to send the messages
2021-09-02 09:46:11.840 Dean:    if an awake and ping are sent right next to each other, the second one is lost
2021-09-02 09:45:45.270 Dean:    FCW has a message queue problem
2021-09-02 09:45:35.530 Dean:

2021-09-01 13:57:41.900 Dean:    after 6 days I notice 2gb of RAM has been consumed
2021-09-01 13:57:24.770 Dean:    but some RAM pool is being used up the longer the program runs
2021-09-01 13:57:06.800 Dean:    the process memory is not increasing
2021-09-01 13:56:54.350 Dean:    but I suspect a GDI+ leak somewhere
2021-09-01 13:56:43.460 Dean:    unsure how and where
2021-09-01 13:56:34.500 Dean:    on SDock I have a memory leak

2021-08-17 10:27:09.400 Dean:    Hello!
2021-08-16 22:30:30.030 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2021-08-16 21:44:48.730 Dean:    tomorrow I will test to do the same and we'll see what happens
2021-08-16 21:44:28.710 Dean:    and it has always worked
2021-08-16 21:44:20.380 Dean:    and it has no option to save as utf-8, it just saves
2021-08-16 21:44:01.880 Dean:    previously I used context
2021-08-16 21:43:53.450 Dean:    and only did it when asked
2021-08-16 21:43:43.940 Dean:    I have not used notepad to open/save before
2021-08-16 21:43:31.970 Dean:    In notepad ANSI came up as the default method
2021-08-16 21:42:58.680 Dean:    I ran FC JS and I could only see your side
2021-08-16 21:42:45.930 Dean:    I could see both sides
2021-08-16 21:42:38.530 Dean:    it was working here
2021-08-16 21:42:30.230 Dean:    nor do I
2021-08-16 21:30:22.230 Dean:    in reality, it will take a while
2021-08-16 21:28:12.670 Dean:    readying myself to remove FSO entirely
2021-08-16 21:27:46.130 Dean:    though imperceptibly so
2021-08-16 21:27:38.860 Dean:    works just as well, in fact probably much quicker
2021-08-16 21:27:23.200 Dean:    using WIN APIs instead
2021-08-16 21:27:16.130 Dean:    just removed two reference to FSO file system object when using it to test for the existence of folders and files
2021-08-16 21:22:17.190 Dean:    much better
2021-08-16 21:07:33.550 Dean:    that bloody glass briefcase is haunting me!
2021-08-16 21:07:18.870 Dean:    anything
2021-08-16 21:07:14.120 Dean:    No, I want a pretty picture
2021-08-16 20:52:36.510 Dean:    and it annoys me
2021-08-16 20:52:32.760 Dean:    I have the folder image in the picbox all the time
2021-08-16 20:52:18.850 Dean:    can you send me a prettier image?
2021-08-16 20:51:58.790 Dean:    
2021-08-16 20:51:53.650 Dean:    the reason I did it? Well someone had warned me that FSO was bloated and unreliable
2021-08-16 20:51:29.090 Dean:    but it was a timely thing to do
2021-08-16 20:51:20.780 Dean:    but I did not enable it nor run it
2021-08-16 20:51:13.360 Dean:    only yesterday
2021-08-16 20:51:02.180 Dean:    strangely enough I copied a version of the routine I need into my codebank (commented out)
2021-08-16 20:50:37.140 Dean:    then I'll start on the code
2021-08-16 20:50:29.130 Dean:    if it happens again (I can do some testing to see if I can recreate it)
2021-08-16 20:49:46.890 Dean:    using notepad
2021-08-16 20:49:39.320 Dean:    so, we have a work around for the moment
2021-08-16 20:49:31.450 Dean:    
2021-08-16 20:49:26.230 Dean:    I'd just rather not
2021-08-16 20:49:20.660 Dean:    I know how to do it
2021-08-16 20:49:11.950 Dean:    instead, I have to write utf-8 binary data 
2021-08-16 20:48:46.850 Dean:    long term I cannot write text in the way I did before
2021-08-16 20:48:24.910 Dean:    
2021-08-16 20:48:19.690 Dean:    those YWE devs knew their stuff
2021-08-16 20:48:04.260 Dean:    another bonus for YWE common code!
2021-08-16 20:47:43.710 Dean:    for win to unix it introduces more complications
2021-08-16 20:47:24.620 Dean:    it will all work for windows and I need no special code for win to win communication
2021-08-16 20:46:47.610 Dean:    it tells me that I need to be more specific for unix systems and utf-8 format files
2021-08-16 20:46:13.980 Dean:    so, now we have seen a problem
2021-08-16 20:46:03.480 Dean:    so I assumed it was doing what it needed to do
2021-08-16 20:45:52.460 Dean:    though I knew that I had seen no problems
2021-08-16 20:45:32.400 Dean:    is supposedly not always compatible with utf-8 files
2021-08-16 20:45:16.760 Dean:    The filesystem object that I use to read/write that handles unix EOL
2021-08-16 20:44:53.010 Dean:    
2021-08-16 20:44:44.460 Dean:    maybe
2021-08-16 20:44:41.060 Dean:    I think there matbe some work I need to do to resolve this longer term
2021-08-16 20:44:14.870 Dean:    and saved it as UTF-8
2021-08-16 20:44:07.190 Dean:    to fix it I opened the file in notepad
2021-08-16 20:43:47.090 Dean:    I did nothing I haven't done before
2021-08-16 20:43:33.340 Dean:    Did I look at it using some other tool? I cannot remember
2021-08-16 20:43:15.530 Dean:    it jsut lost utf-8 encoding
2021-08-16 20:43:06.440 Dean:    I didn't make an edit
2021-08-16 20:40:44.540 Dean:    should be in utf-8 now
2021-08-16 20:40:30.570 Dean:    can you see the text now?
2021-08-16 20:38:51.762 JS Fire Call:    <b><b>
2021-08-16 17:02:13.890 Dean:    Are you doing well?
2021-08-16 15:29:46.810 Dean:    "Enable Tooltips on all controls" is a na example where a description is not really required
2021-08-16 15:29:18.980 Dean:    it might be time to reduce the wordiness on some of the options as I have done
2021-08-16 15:28:57.320 Dean:    It fills my 15" Dell laptop almost...
2021-08-16 15:28:37.130 Dean:    ms, it will be close to going off screen on the smaller devices
2021-08-16 15:28:37.120 Dean:    By the way, I noticed your config tab was growing to such an extent that on Windows 10 with a wider gap between menu ite

2021-08-16 11:15:47.770 Dean:    just seeing what the images look like on occasion

2021-08-16 11:14:31.060 Dean:    and you just work your way through it
2021-08-16 11:14:17.860 Dean:    I've tried to explain that things breaking is normal
2021-08-16 11:13:55.380 Dean:    so I fix things when she isn't here
2021-08-16 11:13:46.540 Dean:    and it depresses her
2021-08-16 11:13:10.610 Dean:    sh works so hard and then she breaks everything she touches
2021-08-16 11:12:47.720 Dean:    £150 disappears into the air
2021-08-16 11:12:30.420 Dean:    she is one of those girls that cannot handle anything mechanical
2021-08-16 11:12:14.230 Dean:    we have a new pool that she bought and she forgot to open the taps
2021-08-16 11:11:47.730 Dean:    she ran the pool pump dry
2021-08-16 11:11:39.790 Dean:    Lucy cannot cope
2021-08-16 11:11:34.880 Dean:    fixing things
2021-08-16 11:11:30.970 Dean:
2021-08-16 11:11:16.110 Dean:    I will do some config in that respect shortly
2021-08-16 11:11:02.730 Dean:    Thanks for the shutdowns
2021-08-16 11:10:46.450 Dean:    NO! Negative shutdown response to shutdown request at 2021-08-16 10:21:27.03
2021-08-16 01:29:00.615 Dean:    NO! Negative shutdown response to shutdown request at 2021-08-15 20:03:53.26
2021-08-15 19:22:46.980 Dean:    when you get the chance, another shutdown would be nice
2021-08-15 19:17:15.030 Dean:    what was the engine problem?
2021-08-15 19:09:48.590 Dean:    I will address that
2021-08-15 19:09:42.650 Dean:    just no message sent back
2021-08-15 19:09:31.610 Dean:    two of those shutdown FCW properly
2021-08-15 19:09:13.840 Dean:    all going well
2021-08-15 19:09:08.150 Dean:    NO! Negative shutdown response to shutdown request at 2021-08-15 19:08:27.92
2021-08-15 19:08:23.380 Dean:    and one more
2021-08-15 19:07:30.390 Dean:    and again pls
2021-08-15 19:06:35.770 Dean:    NO! Negative shutdown response to shutdown request at 2021-08-15 19:05:46.93
2021-08-15 19:06:09.380 Dean:    superb, thankyou
2021-08-15 19:05:25.770 Dean:    and again pls
2021-08-15 19:04:07.710 Dean:    NO! Negative shutdown response to shutdown request at 2021-08-15 19:02:59.48
2021-08-15 19:03:18.140 Dean:    Are the files created by the YWE on Mac ASCII or UTF-8?
2021-08-15 19:02:26.920 Dean:    Harry, Q. for you
2021-08-15 18:55:34.700 Dean:    do send another
2021-08-15 18:32:17.150 Dean:    interesting
2021-08-15 18:31:51.830 Dean:    NO! Negative shutdown response to shutdown request at 2021-08-15 18:30:44.71
2021-08-15 16:59:35.490 Dean:    When I use Xwidget I think what an amazing tool it is and at the same time what a rubbish tool it is
2021-08-15 16:54:45.650 Dean:    as it is often in te way when I want to do something with the systray apps
2021-08-15 16:53:40.200 Dean:    it turns off visiblity for 5 mins
2021-08-15 16:53:21.360 Dean:    added a "go invisible" on a F12 when the widget is selected
2021-08-15 16:52:49.980 Dean:    I did some xwidget coding today
2021-08-15 12:22:39.960 Dean:    testing
2021-08-15 11:25:45.590 Dean:    no worries if you cannot
2021-08-15 10:29:09.550 Dean:    one every two hours or so
2021-08-15 10:29:03.450 Dean:    if you get the chance send me a shutdown from time to time
2021-08-15 10:28:50.100 Dean:    Morning!
2021-08-14 21:25:11.550 Dean:    <><>document-exe.png

2021-08-14 21:21:28.230 Dean:    Shutdown response to shutdown request at 2021-08-14 15:10:04.70
2021-08-14 20:30:54.080 Dean:    have fun
2021-08-14 20:30:51.400 Dean:    no problem
2021-08-14 17:26:01.260 Dean:    that finds the obvious faults
2021-08-14 17:25:54.870 Dean:    and that is good user testing
2021-08-14 17:25:45.870 Dean:    but I am using this version as you are, all the time
2021-08-14 17:25:32.130 Dean:    oh yes
2021-08-14 16:55:08.510 Dean:    shutdown next
2021-08-14 16:54:56.840 Dean:    it opens the relevant folder
2021-08-14 16:54:51.200 Dean:    just made the folder image clickable
2021-08-14 16:51:37.470 Dean:    desist not
2021-08-14 16:51:24.470 Dean:    carry on as usual
2021-08-14 16:51:17.460 Dean:    my code must work
2021-08-14 16:51:09.970 Dean:    no, it is fine
2021-08-14 16:42:51.160 Dean:    have to figure out why
2021-08-14 16:42:43.920 Dean:    with the same text and two timestamps
2021-08-14 16:42:31.650 Dean:    and so it can be left with two entries
2021-08-14 16:42:19.880 Dean:    somehow when you edit that code is getting its knickers confused
2021-08-14 16:41:45.490 Dean:    if they match then the line is left alone
2021-08-14 16:41:23.280 Dean:    one of my optimisations is to check line by line as to whether the listbox and the array match
2021-08-14 16:40:53.470 Dean:    understood
2021-08-14 16:06:54.600 Dean:    of your output file?
2021-08-14 16:06:47.340 Dean:    did you do some editing there?
2021-08-14 15:46:05.950 Dean:    it is somethin MS cannot master
2021-08-14 15:45:59.370 Dean:    don't let windows work out synching ever
2021-08-14 15:45:46.520 Dean:    and that handles the synch. issues
2021-08-14 15:45:33.710 Dean:    on Win I use file synch
2021-08-14 15:36:56.230 Dean:    that replicates the MS one not shipped with Win home
2021-08-14 15:36:40.380 Dean:    it is an open source utility
2021-08-14 15:36:29.370 Dean:    not available unless you purchase windows pr/enterprise
2021-08-14 15:36:16.690 Dean:    it allows access to some sys admin type configuration
2021-08-14 15:36:03.320 Dean:    run when you feel the need
2021-08-14 15:35:56.500 Dean:    to be placed in program files
2021-08-14 15:35:49.420 Dean:    inside is a binary
2021-08-14 15:35:42.900 Dean:    <><>PolicyPlus.zip

2021-08-14 15:35:20.600 Dean:    oh dear
2021-08-14 15:11:18.380 Dean:    adding code to respond
2021-08-14 15:11:10.820 Dean:    showing correctly
2021-08-14 15:04:03.640 Dean:    all working?

2021-08-14 12:48:18.440 Dean:    that image is uninspiring but suitable
2021-08-14 12:47:58.500 Dean:    or if you send a folder
2021-08-14 12:47:49.520 Dean:    my code displays the folders if clicked upon &c

2021-08-14 12:25:00.800 Dean:    I am adding the code to supply a folder image if the dropped item is a folder
2021-08-14 12:24:39.360 Dean:    it does not do the shutdown yet
2021-08-14 12:24:29.810 Dean:    I have added the <z> code to recognise the shutdown request

2021-08-14 11:56:20.400 Dean:    with a tweak
2021-08-14 11:56:13.410 Dean:    my file and folder code is the same
2021-08-14 11:55:40.600 Dean:    but in general I never see a folder with a "." suffix on Windows
2021-08-14 11:55:21.240 Dean:    of course I have encountered .dir as a suffix on VMS
2021-08-14 11:53:56.610 Dean:    the first folder I had encountered with a suffix was your, or the YWE's conversion of a widget folder to sameName.widget
2021-08-14 11:53:07.870 Dean:    typically, a windows folder has no . suffix

2021-08-14 10:14:28.450 Dean:    Lucy is a powerhouse at the moment
2021-08-14 10:14:11.020 Dean:    looks good
2021-08-14 10:14:07.160 Dean:    I made the change last night
2021-08-14 10:13:51.680 Dean:    FCW recognised it as a folder and handled it
2021-08-14 10:11:56.260 Dean:    Good Morning!
2021-08-14 10:11:53.840 Dean:    How's SWMBO?
2021-08-14 00:54:04.852 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2021-08-14 00:24:41.173 Dean:    so I suggest we add <f> for folder
2021-08-14 00:24:11.743 Dean:    but it cannot identify it as anything other than a file
2021-08-14 00:23:50.706 Dean:    FCW can copy a folder
2021-08-14 00:23:27.651 Dean:    <f><f>{folder name}
2021-08-13 23:34:21.727 Dean:    is the encrypted string
2021-08-13 23:34:10.740 Dean:    0+ObVFG1l5rlEWN7DaqHkDa6ycslnLYRStHdBAs=
2021-08-13 23:34:01.974 Dean:    "slartibartfast" is the passcode
2021-08-13 23:33:49.373 Dean:    "twas brillig and slithy toves" is the string
2021-08-13 22:07:30.780 Dean:    Unless we are encryption experts it may be hard to know which scheme each uses
2021-08-13 19:55:33.290 Dean:    ???<Z{?"??
?}
2021-08-13 18:11:23.970 Dean:    thought so
2021-08-13 18:10:21.300 Dean:    was that correct?
2021-08-13 18:10:16.110 Dean:    I didn't use the quotes
2021-08-13 18:10:07.520 Dean:    in quotes?
2021-08-13 18:10:03.420 Dean:    "Secret Password"
2021-08-13 18:09:25.580 Dean:    same as I receive here
2021-08-13 18:09:14.950 Dean:    now I look at the code I posted to you, it looks fine
2021-08-13 18:09:00.980 Dean:    re: my comment above, that was also gibberish
2021-08-13 18:07:57.740 Dean:    FCW When sending a binary, it identifies the type and posts this image in the image picbox
2021-08-13 18:07:04.990 Dean:    <><>FCWSendingBinary.png
2021-08-13 18:05:49.910 Dean:    <><>Project1.exe
2021-08-13 18:05:44.340 Dean:    the encrypted string? don't know what the format of the enc. string is
2021-08-13 18:04:56.700 Dean:    sendign the update .exe now, OK?
2021-08-13 18:04:44.360 Dean:    don't knopw why
2021-08-13 18:04:39.910 Dean:    it looks different as to how it pasted into the  FCW
2021-08-13 18:04:23.810 Dean:    when I look at it here
2021-08-13 18:02:24.410 Dean:    ready
2021-08-13 18:02:22.250 Dean:    when you are erady
2021-08-13 18:02:16.750 Dean:    I'll send you the updated .exe that encrypts/decrypts
2021-08-13 18:01:52.000 Dean:    hmmm
2021-08-13 18:00:29.530 Dean:    when I run it forward/backward it does the job on its own strings
2021-08-13 17:59:35.330 Dean:    testing it myself here to see if it encrypts/decrypts as I expect
2021-08-13 17:59:14.040 Dean:    as I assume they are fundamentally different
2021-08-13 17:58:58.360 Dean:    which is what I expected

2021-08-13 17:58:01.360 Dean:    I receive gibberish
2021-08-13 17:57:54.700 Dean:
2021-08-13 16:00:44.020 Dean:    but not suitable obviously for talking to the .js version
2021-08-13 16:00:22.430 Dean:    I can certainly use that AES encryption code for VB6- VB6 FCW transfer
2021-08-13 14:16:46.250 Dean:    worth watching
2021-08-13 14:16:41.340 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNN_bcX6PtU
2021-08-13 13:55:43.800 Dean:    dropbox still working afterwards?
2021-08-13 13:33:38.280 Dean:    and uses the code as provided
2021-08-13 13:33:32.500 Dean:    as it has no dependencies
2021-08-13 13:33:24.660 Dean:    it should run without problems
2021-08-13 13:33:09.950 Dean:    if you install VB6 you can compile it yourself
2021-08-13 13:32:25.510 Dean:    on your final location
2021-08-13 13:32:13.800 Dean:    then set an exclusion
2021-08-13 13:32:02.790 Dean:    I will retransfer
2021-08-13 13:31:57.810 Dean:    turn it off for the moment

2021-08-13 13:18:15.840 Dean:    and so it may not be as complex not a powerful as the routines you are using
2021-08-13 13:17:53.060 Dean:    The concept was simple encryption
2021-08-13 13:16:53.070 Dean:    that last is a folder

2021-08-12 18:50:55.580 Dean:    righto
2021-08-12 18:50:37.250 Dean:    A shutdown code?
2021-08-12 18:47:14.370 Dean:    perhaps we need a code to tell the remote tool to refresh and load the new file from scratch?
2021-08-12 18:41:45.480 Dean:    but no errors
2021-08-12 18:41:26.800 Dean:    as in it would not update
2021-08-12 18:41:17.450 Dean:    I experienced a lock up of some sort at this end
2021-08-12 18:40:53.090 Dean:    considering I wasn't using it
2021-08-12 18:40:41.440 Dean:    do you know how that occurred?
2021-08-12 18:40:29.900 Dean:    you know that conflict FC had earlier
2021-08-12 18:39:50.440 Dean:    https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?862103-VB6-Simple-AES-256-bit-password-protected-encryption

2021-08-12 16:36:40.650 Dean:    but could be plugged in later
2021-08-12 16:36:31.300 Dean:    separate from FC
2021-08-12 16:36:17.910 Dean:    and you could see if you could create a .js version that attempts to decrypt
2021-08-12 16:35:50.780 Dean:    that uses the AES code
2021-08-12 16:35:41.830 Dean:    I could create a simple VB6 program with an encrypt button
2021-08-12 16:34:57.380 Dean:    but it could be a standalone tool
2021-08-12 16:34:45.790 Dean:    You could test it with FC
2021-08-12 16:34:00.550 Dean:    using AES?
2021-08-12 16:33:50.970 Dean:    How about working on an end to end encryption tool?
2021-08-12 15:40:14.720 Dean:    That ThinBasic came from nowhere
2021-08-12 15:39:42.860 Dean:    for the desktop
2021-08-12 15:32:49.250 Dean:    so, perhaps there is a new contender in the .js sphere?
2021-08-12 15:32:33.030 Dean:    and TwinBasic
2021-08-12 15:32:28.820 Dean:    and we have RADBasic
2021-08-12 15:32:19.860 Dean:    After all, in the last two years we have thinbasic which appeared from nowhere
2021-08-12 15:31:57.450 Dean:    perhaps do a search and see if there is any new technology as a poss. replacement for YWE
2021-08-12 15:30:33.790 Dean:    How are you today?
2021-08-12 15:30:33.130 Dean:    Are you both well?
2021-08-12 15:30:22.400 Dean:    How are you today?

2021-08-11 14:55:12.300 Dean:    I have to complete it my 'proper' way, then test
2021-08-11 14:54:54.610 Dean:    I had implemented some of the ping stuff temporarily
2021-08-11 14:54:15.070 Dean:    then awake and ping ensuring it is done correctly under the hood

2021-08-11 14:17:52.770 Dean:    I expect it would all feel very alien
2021-08-11 14:17:40.170 Dean:    all different now
2021-08-11 14:08:06.700 Dean:    I felt more alien in France than in South Africa
2021-08-11 14:07:41.900 Dean:    strange to think of myself as a legacy of empire...
2021-08-11 14:07:11.960 Dean:    the societal norms, cultural similarities and the dominance of white culture at that time
2021-08-11 14:06:46.990 Dean:    everything reminiscent of the UK in town/street names
2021-08-11 14:06:20.410 Dean:    it felt quite 'normal' to be there
2021-08-11 14:06:07.250 Dean:    and that was due to a hangover from the colonial times
2021-08-11 14:05:49.960 Dean:    but I never felt alien
2021-08-11 14:05:43.960 Dean:    of
2021-08-11 14:05:42.440 Dean:    I lived in S.Africa for a couple if years +
2021-08-11 14:05:20.580 Dean:    I had a little revelation in my own mind
2021-08-11 14:05:06.410 Dean:    and what it is like to feel alien
2021-08-11 14:04:49.850 Dean:    I was reading an essay of my daughter's about immigration and how the newcomer feels alien
2021-08-11 14:04:18.720 Dean:
2021-08-11 14:03:36.280 Dean:    Made in the 90s but still stands the test of time
2021-08-11 14:03:19.340 Dean:    Have you seen Star Trek "first Contact"?
2021-08-11 14:02:42.170 Dean:    solid state memory in rectangular 'cards' predated SD cards by decades
2021-08-11 14:01:15.260 Dean:    The use of memory cards always impressed me
2021-08-11 13:59:57.780 Dean:    I wouldn't willingly use one
2021-08-11 13:59:19.030 Dean:    the transporters have ethical and personal preservation problems that no-one seems to have really thought about
2021-08-11 13:57:31.400 Dean:    they have rules about the time travel thing, though they seem to fail to observe them
2021-08-11 13:56:58.800 Dean:    phasers and tricorders not yet though
2021-08-11 13:56:25.340 Dean:    there are even some that look like the originals
2021-08-11 13:56:11.190 Dean:    you can purchase hand held communicators too - phones!
2021-08-11 13:55:51.090 Dean:    yes
2021-08-11 13:53:09.910 Dean:    but overall a spectacle
2021-08-11 13:53:00.150 Dean:    An occasional liberty taken with physics, time and space &c and some silly bits
2021-08-11 13:52:15.520 Dean:    The beginning was quite good
2021-08-11 13:51:41.430 Dean:    all in all it feels like an episode of Star Trek
2021-08-11 13:51:23.220 Dean:    some good bits
2021-08-11 13:51:17.940 Dean:    not bad
2021-08-11 13:51:15.570 Dean:    yes, that's the one
2021-08-11 13:49:58.610 Dean:    the modern reboot
2021-08-11 13:49:41.000 Dean:    I think I know the one you mean
2021-08-11 13:49:26.160 Dean:    a film?
2021-08-11 13:45:43.100 Dean:    or on youtube?
2021-08-11 13:45:27.440 Dean:    was it on telly?
2021-08-11 13:15:47.740 Dean:    which star trek did you watch?
2021-08-11 13:15:37.900 Dean:
2021-08-11 13:10:38.230 Dean:    these are just thoughts at the moment
2021-08-11 13:10:29.480 Dean:
2021-08-11 13:10:27.690 Dean:    it seems to be set up that way
2021-08-11 13:10:18.730 Dean:    I am hoping it works out of the box as it were
2021-08-11 13:10:05.240 Dean:    and I don't particulalry fancy digging into it
2021-08-11 13:09:52.350 Dean:    the AES code is not mine though
2021-08-11 13:09:40.340 Dean:     perhaps some time in the future
2021-08-11 13:09:30.530 Dean:    so not easy
2021-08-11 13:09:27.210 Dean:    be encoded...
2021-08-11 13:09:27.160 Dean:    and I assume that if you had a .js AES code then it would be a matter of sharing the decryption codes that also need to
2021-08-11 13:08:32.060 Dean:    I have some AES encryption code
2021-08-11 13:08:22.020 Dean:    if you have any thoughts they would be appreciated
2021-08-11 13:08:05.370 Dean:    whether we would encrypt the whole file and decrypt on the fly
2021-08-11 13:07:42.160 Dean:    how that would be done I am unsure
2021-08-11 13:07:29.550 Dean:    as end to end encryption
2021-08-11 13:07:15.930 Dean:    One thought would be to add the option to implement AES encryption
2021-08-11 13:06:46.630 Dean:
2021-08-11 13:06:37.820 Dean:    as Dropbox can see the contents of your files
2021-08-11 13:06:27.280 Dean:    but not end to end
2021-08-11 13:06:21.620 Dean:    Dropbox provides point to point encryption
2021-08-11 13:06:00.640 Dean:    I don't want you to dive in and create code! but...
2021-08-11 13:05:46.200 Dean:    Q. for you
2021-08-11 13:05:41.150 Dean:
2021-08-11 13:05:30.440 Dean:    FCW is becoming very useful
2021-08-11 12:34:29.690 Dean:    it is acceptable though
2021-08-11 12:34:00.980 Dean:    one problem with running the combined chatboxes is that the scroll updown is much slower
2021-08-11 12:33:35.640 Dean:
2021-08-11 12:32:26.640 Dean:    so I think I won't try!
2021-08-11 12:31:07.510 Dean:    the reconstructing split lines is a task I can't get my head around
2021-08-11 12:30:44.240 Dean:
2021-08-11 11:28:11.520 Dean:    It is possible supposedly with .NET
2021-08-11 11:27:51.680 Dean:    it is a pity that I cannot highlight a URL in blue but that is something a VB6 listbox cannot do
2021-08-11 11:26:40.520 Dean:
2021-08-11 11:26:01.710 Dean:    it uses a URL validation tool in Windows to test the URL beforehand

2021-08-11 11:24:32.840 Dean:    but it will do for the moment
2021-08-11 11:24:15.430 Dean:    it does not help with very long, split lines
2021-08-11 11:23:58.210 Dean:    if none found then the whole thing is a URL
2021-08-11 11:23:44.150 Dean:    and in the end just opted for finding an ordinary space in the string
2021-08-11 11:23:03.710 Dean:    I was trying to identify the beginning (easy) and the end of a URL

2021-08-11 09:50:35.490 Dean:    I wanted to identify a URL and then highlight it in blue
2021-08-11 09:50:15.430 Dean:    by changing its colour
2021-08-11 09:50:08.530 Dean:    you cannot highlight a specific portion of a string in a list box item
2021-08-11 09:49:47.080 Dean:    I tried to highlight a URL in a listbox but found it is not possible
2021-08-11 09:49:04.830 Dean:    do you have any code to identify a URL in a string?

2021-08-10 18:42:32.950 Dean:    I've also updated the help
2021-08-10 18:41:45.910 Dean:    the GDI+clock will have to wait for while
2021-08-10 18:41:28.150 Dean:    they are on the bottom of the list but I need to bring them up a bit and finish it
2021-08-10 18:41:07.250 Dean:    just to make them fit the spec
2021-08-10 18:40:58.350 Dean:    I do have to fix the awake and possibly the ping
2021-08-10 18:40:36.990 Dean:    and let you try it
2021-08-10 18:40:29.740 Dean:    and attempt an installation on my other PCs
2021-08-10 18:40:16.270 Dean:    and then I will package it up, create the manifest
2021-08-10 18:40:01.450 Dean:    so next task is the email
2021-08-10 18:39:53.020 Dean:

2021-08-10 18:17:15.360 Dean:     from a previous line in the chat)
2021-08-10 18:17:04.040 Dean:    (that last line was a cut and paste
2021-08-10 18:16:45.270 Dean:    and the image is changed to one that has a shadowed region only when the image is showing
2021-08-10 18:16:21.090 Dean:    it seems to be working quickly and responsively

2021-08-10 14:32:10.610 Dean:    to one without a shadow
2021-08-10 14:32:01.640 Dean:    the underlying control box image is changed when the image is closed
2021-08-10 14:31:43.410 Dean:    it is of course a kludge
2021-08-10 14:31:36.730 Dean:    or any other tool that can handle transparencies
2021-08-10 14:31:24.090 Dean:    I have added a proper graduated shadow to the image just as you might see on YWE
2021-08-10 14:30:57.730 Dean:    and wrong
2021-08-10 14:30:53.750 Dean:    it looked very old school
2021-08-10 14:30:46.350 Dean:    to simulate a shadow
2021-08-10 14:30:41.210 Dean:    it was bugging me that I had to resort to a solid black underlying box positioned jut to the right and down a bit
2021-08-10 14:30:07.200 Dean:    just added a shadow to the picturebox
2021-08-10 14:29:45.710 Dean:
2021-08-10 14:19:03.610 Dean:    then I could run it on those when I have time
2021-08-10 14:18:49.200 Dean:    so if you come up with a simple widget to test
2021-08-10 14:18:33.880 Dean:    and may even be able to run XP

2021-08-10 14:08:52.300 Dean:    on your old mac
2021-08-10 14:08:45.360 Dean:    you have the power to test
2021-08-10 12:42:18.450 Dean:    the hoizontal scrollbar functions
2021-08-10 12:41:35.620 Dean:    it doesn't all have to be elegant!
2021-08-10 12:40:57.580 Dean:    but simple enough
2021-08-10 12:40:50.540 Dean:    not as elegant as I'd like
2021-08-10 12:40:35.680 Dean:    though they are a bit of a kludge
2021-08-10 12:40:19.620 Dean:    the right click menu operations function too
2021-08-10 12:40:02.050 Dean:    they all use the same code
2021-08-10 12:39:56.200 Dean:    my combined chat box now responds to all click operations as per the other boxes
2021-08-10 12:38:35.220 Dean:    but different enough to screw up some time difference checking or string manipulation
2021-08-10 12:38:09.050 Dean:    OK, so not too different
2021-08-10 12:36:23.650 Dean:    strange

2021-08-09 23:24:41.733 Dean:    so it may suit you better
2021-08-09 23:24:34.479 Dean:    it should work in a similar fashion now to .js FC
2021-08-09 23:24:22.404 Dean:    but when all done
2021-08-09 23:24:18.648 Dean:    just as the main two windows
2021-08-09 23:24:10.989 Dean:    I now need to make it respond to clicks, key events and right mouse events
2021-08-09 23:23:43.028 Dean:    certainly for the moment
2021-08-09 23:23:38.177 Dean:    so I think this will do
2021-08-09 23:23:30.765 Dean:    or heavily modifying and complicating the current code
2021-08-09 23:23:15.504 Dean:    but that would mean duplication of code for the new box
2021-08-09 23:23:00.752 Dean:    it could be done more efficiently if it was optimised for the single box
2021-08-09 23:22:34.481 Dean:    and then the output of the two listboxes is merged, sorted and then written to the final listbox
2021-08-09 23:21:53.602 Dean:    as the processing is still done for the separate input/output listboxes
2021-08-09 23:21:33.087 Dean:    it is not optimal for a single chat box window
2021-08-09 23:21:17.405 Dean:    so the method I have chosen will work perfectly well
2021-08-09 23:21:03.500 Dean:    I have the single chat box working, initially slowly but with some tuning it is now updating quickly
2021-08-09 22:06:51.030 Dean:    now the routine that writes does a quicksort
2021-08-09 22:06:27.840 Dean:    I have just created the routine that reads the Arrays And Writes the Combined Array
2021-08-09 21:27:16.980 Dean:    once more unto the breach
2021-08-09 21:27:08.060 Dean:    so, no delay!
2021-08-09 21:26:53.620 Dean:    and the email functionality
2021-08-09 21:26:38.120 Dean:    one big listbox containing both sorted input and output
2021-08-09 21:26:17.300 Dean:    so, I now need to finish my two main bits of missing functionality
2021-08-09 21:25:48.740 Dean:    One more bit of documentation to do across the board but that waits until I have a finished version
2021-08-09 21:25:23.270 Dean:    documented
2021-08-09 21:25:18.010 Dean:    All major/minor bugs fixed in FCW

2021-08-09 12:36:54.910 Dean:    just doing some simple tidying here in code
2021-08-09 10:03:04.920 Dean:    pondering
2021-08-09 09:52:22.340 Dean:    it takes me a couple of days to repair
2021-08-09 09:52:12.130 Dean:    2nd day when I will be feeling a little rough

2021-08-08 20:14:46.430 Dean:    documented one of my major modules, ensuring all code has a description of some sort
2021-08-08 20:14:18.860 Dean:    feeling more lively

2021-08-07 09:58:04.110 Dean:    friend here today
2021-08-07 09:57:05.710 Dean:    Morning!
2021-08-06 19:56:19.230 Dean:    That is exactly what I was going to do
2021-08-06 17:59:09.580 Dean:    or just cut the line
2021-08-06 17:59:02.460 Dean:    does it wrap on a space?
2021-08-06 17:17:12.590 Dean:    it is nice to have the cursor keys back again
2021-08-06 17:17:02.830 Dean:    does your code do that?
2021-08-06 17:16:52.840 Dean:    I need to correct that
2021-08-06 17:16:48.160 Dean:    I have just seen that my maximum line legth code is just cutting off text arbitrarily
2021-08-06 17:16:20.340 Dean:    I modified to byVal and it was all repaired
2021-08-06 17:15:29.870 Dean:    ng at my code
2021-08-06 17:15:29.820 Dean:    it was one routine where the variable was passed byval and was changed to byRef as it seemed the right thing to do looki
2021-08-06 17:14:50.370 Dean:    I have fixed the problem where the left/right cursor keys were being ignored
2021-08-06 15:51:42.260 Dean:    rained here too
2021-08-06 15:32:07.070 Dean:    What news?
2021-08-06 15:32:02.940 Dean:    Are you doing well?
2021-08-06 15:32:00.760 Dean:    How are you today?
2021-08-06 15:31:58.740 Dean:    Are you alright?
2021-08-06 15:17:57.650 Dean:    tiny bugs fixed - tooltips
2021-08-06 10:41:55.530 Dean:    very good
2021-08-06 10:38:36.020 Dean:    a friend coming and I have to prepare
2021-08-06 10:38:27.850 Dean:    I masy be offline a lot today so forgive me
2021-08-06 10:37:32.790 Dean:    it is either internal (as previously encountered) or it is file creation thing from Dropbox
2021-08-06 10:37:03.580 Dean:    andstoring the value in a LONG would ever cause an overflow
2021-08-06 10:36:47.370 Dean:    but I want to find out why comparing a date now() with a fileDateTime
2021-08-06 10:36:24.890 Dean:    as that would give me even more of a range in secs and would avoid an overflow
2021-08-06 10:35:51.540 Dean:    I could simply change it to a DECIMAL
2021-08-06 10:35:35.830 Dean:    I am trying to imagine the situation that could cause a date/time range to exceed the 80 years a LONG gives me
2021-08-06 10:35:04.370 Dean:    then I add error checking and made the one irrelevant change and it stopped
2021-08-06 10:34:42.340 Dean:    it happened for several days on a trot
2021-08-06 10:34:25.970 Dean:    but only when an erroro occurs
2021-08-06 10:34:18.320 Dean:    it is totally covered in error traps and breakouts to print vars
2021-08-06 10:33:45.910 Dean:    hay fever worse this year than I remember it before
2021-08-06 10:33:31.680 Dean:    very poor night's sleep last night
2021-08-06 10:33:23.110 Dean:
2021-08-06 10:33:09.800 Dean:    very strange
2021-08-06 10:32:45.490 Dean:    but not why
2021-08-06 10:32:34.520 Dean:    the error was quite clear as to exactly where it is situated and what the error type was
2021-08-06 10:32:00.920 Dean:    I do not like bugs that seem to go away...
2021-08-06 10:31:50.490 Dean:    I will keep the error handling in place and run for a while and see if the bug re-emerges
2021-08-06 10:31:28.150 Dean:    but I do not know why
2021-08-06 10:31:08.460 Dean:    srry about typos. laptop on lap at awkward angle
2021-08-06 10:30:51.120 Dean:    well, that's goo tha tit has gone
2021-08-06 10:30:37.900 Dean:
2021-08-06 10:30:36.520 Dean:    so it should have no effect
2021-08-06 10:30:28.550 Dean:    but its scope is restricted to the other var
2021-08-06 10:30:12.680 Dean:    well, I made a single change to rename a duplicate var name in another function
2021-08-06 10:29:45.570 Dean:    not to prevent it
2021-08-06 10:29:40.230 Dean:    I have only made changes to catch the overflow error
2021-08-06 10:29:19.550 Dean:    Strange, no crash
2021-08-05 22:55:38.310 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2021-08-05 22:55:29.250 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2021-08-05 22:42:57.580 Dean:    small progress made with the large single listbox/chat window
2021-08-05 22:42:28.810 Dean:    so I am definitely inthe finishing zone
2021-08-05 22:42:12.660 Dean:    the other are all minor
2021-08-05 22:42:02.120 Dean:    one remaining
2021-08-05 22:41:57.640 Dean:    I have documented all the functions in two of my main code modules
2021-08-05 19:14:03.310 Dean:    I recommend a watch or two and suspend your opinions until you have given them a try
2021-08-05 19:13:25.470 Dean:    in almost all respects
2021-08-05 19:13:19.040 Dean:    as they are very true to the original
2021-08-05 19:13:08.090 Dean:    Still though, worth watching
2021-08-05 18:58:03.050 Dean:    if you liked the original, of course
2021-08-05 18:57:53.600 Dean:    Very similar to the original
2021-08-05 18:56:56.120 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G-ziTBAkbQ&t=32s
2021-08-05 18:56:55.270 Dean:
2021-08-05 18:56:52.690 Dean:    on another subject
2021-08-05 18:56:43.090 Dean:
2021-08-05 18:56:41.950 Dean:    It has been around for a long time
2021-08-05 18:56:03.940 Dean:    Do you have a thorough knowledge of AppleScript?
2021-08-05 15:36:06.750 Dean:    but nonetheless I decided to rename one var in one routine
2021-08-05 15:35:41.930 Dean:    so each should not affect the other
2021-08-05 15:35:31.790 Dean:    the two routines are encapsulated and do not share vars
2021-08-05 15:34:43.280 Dean:    to be be declared as an INT in another routine
2021-08-05 15:34:26.750 Dean:    timeDiffInSecs
2021-08-05 15:33:46.560 Dean:    I found the same var,
2021-08-05 15:33:40.330 Dean:    with regard to my persistent LONG overload bug
2021-08-05 11:41:17.790 Dean:    manual translation?
2021-08-05 11:19:34.230 Dean:     Windspeed is 12 knots, force 4, direction SE
2021-08-05 11:19:34.090 Dean:     Partly cloudy at 3000 ft.

2021-08-05 11:19:33.410 Dean:     EGSH NORWICH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM
2021-08-05 11:19:33.220 Dean:     Thu Aug 05 2021 10:50:00 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time)
2021-08-05 11:19:23.750 Dean:    very solid sleep last night, no hayfever
2021-08-05 11:18:43.530 Dean:    and see what it does
2021-08-05 11:18:37.150 Dean:    so I'll run it tonight compiled
2021-08-05 11:18:24.860 Dean:    met
2021-08-05 11:18:22.020 Dean:    none me, no messages
2021-08-05 11:18:11.020 Dean:    and extra error trapping and reporting if it met any of the conditions that might cause an error
2021-08-05 11:17:37.020 Dean:    I had a breakpoint set so catch it if it did
2021-08-05 11:17:21.310 Dean:    in the IDE...
2021-08-05 11:17:16.980 Dean:    well the error did nt occur last night
2021-08-04 22:30:28.530 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2021-08-04 22:30:26.270 Dean:    off to bed
2021-08-04 22:30:17.010 Dean:    she is just still young enough to do that
2021-08-04 22:30:06.410 Dean:    she still loves to come home and be our daughter
2021-08-04 22:29:48.550 Dean:    been cuddling up and chatting about life
2021-08-04 22:29:23.860 Dean:    daughter came home from uni.
2021-08-04 17:56:37.440 Dean:    and optimise the method
2021-08-04 17:56:23.630 Dean:    then I will see about merging it into the existing code
2021-08-04 17:55:19.300 Dean:    hoping not
2021-08-04 17:55:11.940 Dean:    and we'll see if that has a perceptible slow down
2021-08-04 17:54:49.590 Dean:    and I will simply transfer the data to the new array, sort and populate the new box
2021-08-04 17:54:30.650 Dean:    all the message filtering will remain where it is
2021-08-04 17:54:13.260 Dean:    and the code to populate it
2021-08-04 17:54:06.620 Dean:    a new array and listbox have been created
2021-08-04 17:53:52.160 Dean:    working on the code to create one bigger chat box
2021-08-04 15:51:01.220 Dean:    slow but sure
2021-08-04 15:28:50.180 Dean:    documented all functions - WIP fireCallMain 63%
2021-08-04 15:28:47.810 Dean:
2021-08-04 14:16:56.640 Dean:    so no changes required
2021-08-04 14:16:49.780 Dean:    so I am just going to see how my code stand up tonight with err handlers
2021-08-04 14:16:30.410 Dean:    and how you described it was correct
2021-08-04 14:16:14.660 Dean:    I think we are OK
2021-08-04 14:16:09.820 Dean:    not looking in detail at the mo'
2021-08-04 14:15:38.640 Dean:    understood now
2021-08-04 14:11:06.350 Dean:    f
2021-08-04 14:11:04.990 Dean:    which should give enough seconds gor 80 years
2021-08-04 14:10:53.800 Dean:    as a long
2021-08-04 14:10:50.680 Dean:    and the var is declared correctly that stores the time diff in secs
2021-08-04 14:10:16.900 Dean:    both those functions are VB6 intrinsic functions
2021-08-04 14:10:00.610 Dean:    or the result of the dateDiff
2021-08-04 14:09:44.940 Dean:    the overflow is a result of a weird value form the getFileDateTime function
2021-08-04 14:09:14.510 Dean:    it is never assigned soem unknown value that causes it to revert to an integer
2021-08-04 14:08:51.480 Dean:    and it is valid again
2021-08-04 14:08:40.710 Dean:    it is valid and then it is recalculated
2021-08-04 14:08:17.650 Dean:    the timediff is never reset
2021-08-04 14:08:05.190 Dean:    very simple
2021-08-04 14:07:46.320 Dean:    it is set then stays that value until the next poll
2021-08-04 14:07:23.810 Dean:    never
2021-08-04 13:50:04.230 Dean:    thatit really confuses
2021-08-04 13:49:16.520 Dean:    but it is when the language or environment throws a wobbly
2021-08-04 13:48:58.520 Dean:    It should be easy enough
2021-08-04 13:48:49.950 Dean:
2021-08-04 13:39:21.660 Dean:    if I cannot deal with it myself
2021-08-04 13:39:14.080 Dean:    if it happens again I will raise it on the VBforum
2021-08-04 13:38:54.520 Dean:
2021-08-04 13:38:44.430 Dean:    and not the date/time stamp
2021-08-04 13:38:36.110 Dean:    previously it did not occur as I was checking the lineCount
2021-08-04 13:38:22.960 Dean:    and then make a decision
2021-08-04 13:38:11.860 Dean:    so that I can see what happens, if it occurs again in the IDE
2021-08-04 13:37:50.820 Dean:    I will run FCW in the IDE overnight, with various breakpoints set
2021-08-04 13:29:15.340 Dean:    I think you are right
2021-08-04 12:24:54.070 Dean:    Awake response. Request time: 2021-08-04 12:24:28.68
2021-08-04 12:24:53.390 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Microsoft Windows XP  Version:0.0.991
2021-08-04 11:50:54.040 Dean:    hmmm
2021-08-04 11:47:55.570 Dean:    what do you think?
2021-08-04 11:47:49.480 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:47:37.970 Dean:    it should be a file of some sort
2021-08-04 11:47:08.370 Dean:    and only attempt to read when the semaphore is clear
2021-08-04 11:46:49.610 Dean:    I should check for existence of that semaphore
2021-08-04 11:46:36.000 Dean:    i suppose we should really have a semaphore flag to indicate when you are recreating your output file
2021-08-04 11:45:56.880 Dean:    I am now testing for all such occurrences
2021-08-04 11:45:36.320 Dean:    or var being forced to an integer (which I have encountered before with a workaround)
2021-08-04 11:45:06.080 Dean:    so it is either one date being null or malformed
2021-08-04 11:44:53.730 Dean:    an overflow is typically caused by the result exceedign the max
2021-08-04 11:44:17.320 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:44:04.790 Dean:    both of which will cause the routine to exit
2021-08-04 11:43:45.560 Dean:    If IsNull(fileModificationTime) Then Exit Sub
2021-08-04 11:43:27.290 Dean:    I am also checking for a nulldate
2021-08-04 11:43:16.640 Dean:    possible occasions whenthe file is being recreated
2021-08-04 11:43:02.330 Dean:    but it will catch more
2021-08-04 11:42:53.970 Dean:    not perfect
2021-08-04 11:42:44.680 Dean:    before it extracts the fileModificationTime
2021-08-04 11:42:25.050 Dean:    for the moment I have added a line previous that checks for the files existence
2021-08-04 11:41:57.710 Dean:    I could do the maths myself but when there is a VB6 function it is wise to use the known function
2021-08-04 11:41:28.620 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:33:09.290 Dean:    hmmm
2021-08-04 11:19:49.280 Dean:    I will add a check for that
2021-08-04 11:19:40.940 Dean:    possibly
2021-08-04 11:19:37.510 Dean:    and so the file modification date is zero?
2021-08-04 11:19:22.110 Dean:    Ah, could it be that the input file is being file is being recreated at that time?
2021-08-04 11:17:55.160 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:17:54.360 Dean:    I may have to do a workaround avoiding datediff
2021-08-04 11:17:34.890 Dean:    I am sure that is it, having encountered somethign like it before
2021-08-04 11:17:19.280 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:17:07.740 Dean:    it is as if the internal comparison of the two dates is forcing an internal value to an integer
2021-08-04 11:16:38.220 Dean:    as it shows valid dates at the point of failure
2021-08-04 11:15:58.960 Dean:    error checking has proven this
2021-08-04 11:15:52.810 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:15:42.050 Dean:    as if the timeDiffInSecs has somehow reverted to a integer holding values <32768
2021-08-04 11:14:57.460 Dean:    an
2021-08-04 11:14:56.070 Dean:    it generates and overflow error
2021-08-04 11:14:46.200 Dean:    but if I leave it longer than 9hrs
2021-08-04 11:14:33.180 Dean:    every 15 secs
2021-08-04 11:14:26.500 Dean:    that works all the time
2021-08-04 11:14:21.790 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:14:20.390 Dean:        End If
2021-08-04 11:14:20.220 Dean:            Exit Sub
2021-08-04 11:14:20.060 Dean:        If timeDiffInSecs = 0 Then
2021-08-04 11:14:18.540 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:14:17.990 Dean:    then if there is no difference simply exit
2021-08-04 11:14:08.930 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:13:57.980 Dean:        timeDiffInSecs = DateDiff("s", oldFileModificationTime, fileModificationTime)
2021-08-04 11:13:57.820 Dean:    fileModificationTime = FileDateTime(FCWSharedInputFile)
2021-08-04 11:13:56.370 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:13:55.690 Dean:    I do a file datetime check and compare it to the stored old time
2021-08-04 11:13:31.520 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:13:19.200 Dean:    that ought to give a max 86 years as a LONG in secs
2021-08-04 11:13:01.010 Dean:    Dim timeDiffInSecs As Long
2021-08-04 11:12:59.600 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:12:59.030 Dean:    the var in question is defined as a LONG
2021-08-04 11:12:42.350 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:12:40.800 Dean:    Public oldFileModificationTime As Date
2021-08-04 11:12:40.610 Dean:    Public fileModificationTime As Date
2021-08-04 11:12:39.100 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:12:38.360 Dean:    the two dates are defined as DATE types
2021-08-04 11:12:18.210 Dean:    when comparing dates
2021-08-04 11:12:11.860 Dean:    it is an overflow of a long integer
2021-08-04 11:11:58.950 Dean:    I have a bug that I cannot fathom
2021-08-04 11:11:51.590 Dean:
2021-08-04 11:11:41.250 Dean:    quite relieved
2021-08-04 11:11:34.070 Dean:    thought it was one of my changes
2021-08-04 11:11:07.110 Dean:    you have done a re-org. of the exchange folder

2021-08-03 12:02:44.240 Dean:    Are you alright?
2021-08-03 11:33:46.950 Dean:    agreed
2021-08-03 11:00:12.960 Dean:    using POP3\IMAP and SMTP to achieve the things you want
2021-08-03 10:59:57.480 Dean:    generally people say avoid outlook and do what VBsendmail does
2021-08-03 10:58:44.230 Dean:    https://www.google.com/search?q=outlook+CLSID&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
2021-08-03 10:58:42.400 Dean:    nope
2021-08-03 10:57:32.180 Dean:    and emulate the YWE version of the clock
2021-08-03 10:57:23.390 Dean:    and then I can add graphical hands
2021-08-03 10:57:03.530 Dean:    I now need find examples of rotating images around a specific point
2021-08-03 10:56:32.850 Dean:    the clock I have found simply draws lines for the hands much in the same way we are currently doing
2021-08-03 10:55:45.640 Dean:    quite a lot
2021-08-03 10:55:39.610 Dean:    the main difference is the amount of GDI+ API declarations
2021-08-03 10:55:13.650 Dean:     it is very similar to what I am doing in VB6 code
2021-08-03 10:54:57.080 Dean:    I have the code to bring a GDI+ clock into FCW
2021-08-03 10:53:57.570 Dean:    very good
2021-08-03 10:32:54.550 Dean:    that is the VB6 versions of sendmail
2021-08-03 10:32:38.330 Dean:    <><>vbsendmail(1).zip
2021-08-03 10:27:27.470 Dean:    so, I have added some error trapping around it
2021-08-03 10:27:12.360 Dean:    but when left to do its thing it can fail after a system wake up
2021-08-03 10:26:50.800 Dean:    works well
2021-08-03 10:26:46.470 Dean:    fromt he file
2021-08-03 10:26:43.140 Dean:    and if the value is zero it extracts the data
2021-08-03 10:26:22.880 Dean:    I am mereley doing a dateDiff, assigning the value to a LONG
2021-08-03 10:26:00.690 Dean:    then it falls over with an overflow
2021-08-03 10:25:53.190 Dean:    but it keeps showing the lamp repeatedly as if the file has been modified
2021-08-03 10:25:23.520 Dean:    so it should give me 86 years of time boundary
2021-08-03 10:25:01.710 Dean:    is a LONG
2021-08-03 10:24:57.260 Dean:    the timediffinSecs
2021-08-03 10:24:47.060 Dean:    I have been receiving an occasional overflow err when leaving FCW running and waking the system from a sleep

2021-08-03 10:23:40.130 Dean:    outlook was the default app for email once upon a time
2021-08-03 10:22:41.590 Dean:    I have not even tested it yet
2021-08-03 10:22:35.260 Dean:    and was not expecting to have to until it failed
2021-08-03 10:22:19.460 Dean:    I have not looked into it in any detail
2021-08-03 10:22:08.800 Dean:    I could send you the VB6 zip if you wanted but it may be of limited use
2021-08-03 10:21:47.770 Dean:    I am sure the same exists for .js if it exists for VB6
2021-08-03 10:21:11.990 Dean:    instead  using the pop/SMTP values and sending its own email without using any email client
2021-08-03 10:20:34.470 Dean:    that does not assume an email client
2021-08-03 10:20:18.370 Dean:    I have a vbsendmail
2021-08-03 10:20:00.500 Dean:    assuming that everyone has outlook is a mistake
2021-08-03 10:19:48.270 Dean:    I found various solution in VB6 that looked for the same object
2021-08-03 10:19:24.820 Dean:    it is not intrinsically installed these days
2021-08-03 10:19:11.970 Dean:    If you do not have outlook installed then it will have a problem
