creation thing from Dropbox2021-08-06 10:37:03.580 Dean:    andstoring the value in a LONG would ever cause an overflow2021-08-06 10:36:47.370 Dean:    but I want to find out why comparing a date now() with a fileDateTime2021-08-06 10:36:24.890 Dean:    as that would give me even more of a range in secs and would avoid an overflow2021-08-06 10:35:51.540 Dean:    I could simply change it to a DECIMAL2021-08-06 10:35:35.830 Dean:    I am trying to imagine the situation that could cause a date/time range to exceed the 80 years a LONG gives me2021-08-06 10:35:04.370 Dean:    then I add error checking and made the one irrelevant change and it stopped2021-08-06 10:34:42.340 Dean:    it happened for several days on a trot2021-08-06 10:34:25.970 Dean:    but only when an erroro
