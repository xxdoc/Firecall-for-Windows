2022-03-17 16:28:04.882 Dean:    
2022-03-17 16:28:03.290 Dean:    it is an unnecessary belt and braces anyway
2022-03-17 16:27:43.667 Dean:    removing Do Events fixed it
2022-03-17 16:27:34.801 Dean:    and int he combined window it failed altogether
2022-03-17 16:27:21.601 Dean:    but when it overlapped the bottom window it did not
2022-03-17 16:27:11.210 Dean:    when the upper menu was overlapping the bottom split window it worked
2022-03-17 16:26:39.602 Dean:    a strange bug with DoEvents that is meant to clear the current outstanding event list but it is affected by the mouse position and which control has focus
2022-03-17 16:25:52.153 Dean:    fixed copy and quote menu option in the combined text window
2022-03-17 16:25:30.449 Dean:    FCW - some small coding

2022-03-17 11:21:06.600 Dean:    for example
2022-03-17 11:21:03.001 Dean:    so, I could have an evening with Lucy
2022-03-17 11:20:52.288 Dean:    so that you can hire someone to care for your dependant and then go out
2022-03-17 11:20:20.433 Dean:    I have been told there is a respite group that can provide up to £500 for respite care

2022-03-16 11:52:47.536 Dean:    testing!

2022-03-14 22:49:40.571 Dean:    dismounting and possibly dismantling the old battery tomorrow
2022-03-14 22:49:19.440 Dean:    all my 18650s are now tested
2022-03-14 22:49:06.015 Dean:    
2022-03-14 22:48:58.636 Dean:    We now have to open it, drill it, solder a cable to the connectors , remove the reamaining prongs, add strain relief
2022-03-14 22:48:06.204 Dean:    I go for solid metal prongs  where possible, v. old style
2022-03-14 22:47:40.755 Dean:    I told him that I always replace such devices with proper plugs that can be earthed
2022-03-14 22:47:05.795 Dean:    the prong broke
2022-03-14 22:47:00.864 Dean:    my boy paid for an expensive PSU to provide power to USB 3 units (he never takes nor asks for my advice) and he bought a unit whose plug had no earth and just a plastic  top prong
2022-03-14 22:45:37.595 Dean:    if I can't find one here will order one
2022-03-14 18:54:47.373 Dean:    see if I have one in my stock
2022-03-14 18:54:35.906 Dean:    I need to obtain one of the two pin connectors
2022-03-14 18:54:15.603 Dean:    I have plenty going spare
2022-03-14 17:45:28.250 Dean:    does the spec sheet state what is required? 5-12v DC specified on the board
2022-03-14 17:44:54.516 Dean:    to power the things
2022-03-14 17:44:44.931 Dean:    I think we might need a PSU next
2022-03-14 17:44:32.555 Dean:    we have proven that
2022-03-14 17:44:22.931 Dean:    your brain is superior to mine
2022-03-14 17:44:09.803 Dean:    that's absolutely true
2022-03-14 16:07:15.306 Dean:    If I manage to obtain more in quantity then I may invest in a device that can do multipel items simultaneously
2022-03-14 15:42:55.651 Dean:    only two more 18650s to test
2022-03-14 13:49:54.961 Dean:    I have my test plan
2022-03-14 13:49:42.066 Dean:    I might have to add a flag to let you know that my output has been automatically archived
2022-03-14 13:49:04.182 Dean:    ready to test the housekeeping task
2022-03-14 13:48:48.106 Dean:    managed some coding

2022-03-14 13:43:49.738 Dean:    CONFUSING CONFUCIOUS
2022-03-14 12:19:41.418 Dean:    just fixing and sorting and tidying
2022-03-14 12:19:32.308 Dean:    no coding for the next few days
2022-03-14 12:18:30.482 Dean:    all whilst looking after mum of course
2022-03-14 12:18:04.490 Dean:    k
2022-03-14 12:18:02.450 Dean:    tricy job
2022-03-14 12:17:59.242 Dean:    and have to be done by touch alone
2022-03-14 12:17:48.842 Dean:    the brushes are a pain to do as they are inaccessible on one side
2022-03-14 12:17:26.867 Dean:    just de-rusting the base
2022-03-14 12:17:07.905 Dean:    I have just replaced the brushes in my Siemens washing machinbe
2022-03-14 12:16:51.762 Dean:    same here
2022-03-14 10:16:10.818 Dean:    Morning!
2022-03-14 00:50:32.055 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-03-13 20:34:01.589 Dean:    a useful skill
2022-03-13 19:18:05.479 Dean:    nice to go out and feel normal
2022-03-13 15:26:03.372 Dean:    all well?
2022-03-13 09:15:39.479 Dean:    Dell laptop decided to shutdown windows this morning rather than wake up from sleep
2022-03-13 09:14:35.559 Dean:    forgot that courtesy
2022-03-13 09:14:28.459 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-03-13 09:14:12.668 Dean:    I have written my own labels for the buttons
2022-03-13 09:13:28.660 Dean:    but the others? I assume  the ones near the + termin al are "positive"
2022-03-13 09:12:53.264 Dean:    The buttons I already know
2022-03-12 22:07:06.246 Dean:    that work starts soon
2022-03-12 22:07:01.542 Dean:    
2022-03-12 22:06:57.452 Dean:    using it as a template
2022-03-12 22:06:36.662 Dean:    so I am planning to replicate it with the best of my batteries
2022-03-12 22:06:15.652 Dean:    it has a approx. 10 miles on it
2022-03-12 22:06:06.038 Dean:    and I knew the battery was low on capacity
2022-03-12 22:05:52.531 Dean:    I bought two wheels and a pack for £80
2022-03-12 22:05:36.072 Dean:    I am about to disassemble a bike battery pack
2022-03-12 22:05:20.660 Dean:    
2022-03-12 22:04:16.192 Dean:    so that's a safe voltage
2022-03-12 22:04:01.020 Dean:    I have no batteries that have a cut off greater than 3.0v
2022-03-12 21:45:33.188 Dean:    clicking on each will provide cut off v data if it exists
2022-03-12 21:45:17.549 Dean:    that is the link for the batteries
2022-03-12 21:45:08.325 Dean:    https://secondlifestorage.com/index.php?pages/cell-database/
2022-03-12 21:39:53.867 Dean:    then I can decide what I do with the things
2022-03-12 21:39:41.055 Dean:    last six 18650s to test/discharge
2022-03-12 21:39:18.091 Dean:    
2022-03-12 21:38:45.069 Dean:    wife's birthday party meal today
2022-03-12 21:38:33.690 Dean:    
2022-03-12 21:37:59.597 Dean:    and each has revived well beyond my expectations
2022-03-12 21:37:45.350 Dean:    which is their nominal failure point
2022-03-12 21:37:25.048 Dean:    having said that, a lot of the batteries I am successfully resurrecting fell below 2.5v
2022-03-12 12:53:01.991 Dean:    to ensure no accidental damage
2022-03-12 12:52:49.840 Dean:    I always drain them to a higher value
2022-03-12 12:52:34.448 Dean:    so I drained them to 2.8v
2022-03-12 12:52:04.677 Dean:    my pink Samsung 2600mAh are 2.75
2022-03-12 12:51:24.155 Dean:    fast discharge/low discharge/high capacity
2022-03-12 12:51:06.232 Dean:    it is moreto do with the mfr, capacity and type
2022-03-12 11:51:17.518 Dean:    the site secondlife has the cut off voltages listed
2022-03-12 11:50:59.933 Dean:    that is what (I have learnt so far
2022-03-12 11:50:47.145 Dean:    higher capacities have higher cut offs
2022-03-12 11:50:35.399 Dean:    depending upon the capacity it would seem
2022-03-12 11:50:18.233 Dean:     the cut off range from 2.5 to 3.0v
2022-03-12 11:50:02.422 Dean:    I think I sent you a link earlier to a list of battery types
2022-03-12 11:49:42.806 Dean:    each battery type is different
2022-03-11 19:30:03.522 Dean:    you might video that!
2022-03-11 17:18:55.970 Dean:    have you thought of a good use yet?
2022-03-11 17:18:46.954 Dean:    the millimg table
2022-03-11 17:18:40.706 Dean:    
2022-03-11 17:18:02.026 Dean:    the residtor discharges at approx 450mAh
2022-03-11 17:16:33.417 Dean:    and I have 78!
2022-03-11 17:16:29.178 Dean:    I have tested 65 batteries
2022-03-11 17:16:15.721 Dean:    mine has freed up well now
2022-03-11 17:16:05.812 Dean:    especially tight for the protected batteries with the pronounced ends
2022-03-11 17:15:35.788 Dean:    The battery terminals are tight but they free up after a while
2022-03-11 17:15:13.090 Dean:    there is a port for a PSU
2022-03-11 17:15:05.563 Dean:    Yes, the battery in the left hand needs to be fully charged and workimng well

2022-03-09 22:47:28.550 Dean:    I'll have to find code or understand the format and adapt
2022-03-09 22:47:13.798 Dean:    my FCW program will certainly not read them
2022-03-09 22:46:59.318 Dean:    I will have to research
2022-03-09 21:08:12.837 Dean:    never met them before you sent me  the last two or three .HEIC images
2022-03-09 20:34:04.285 Dean:    I was not aware of their existence
2022-03-09 20:33:54.262 Dean:    I'd not ever had the need before

2022-03-08 23:43:12.358 Dean:    so I had to fix the emergencyreplacement w/machine
2022-03-08 23:42:47.568 Dean:    
2022-03-08 23:42:45.319 Dean:    and it all worked
2022-03-08 23:42:40.646 Dean:    sprayed contact cleaner into the motor
2022-03-08 23:42:29.555 Dean:    freed on and replaced the brush in the other brush holder

2022-03-08 23:42:05.373 Dean:    removed the brushes on the old commutator motor
2022-03-08 23:41:40.570 Dean:    large storage caps inside so rubber gloves worn
2022-03-08 23:41:17.089 Dean:    so I had to dismantle and tip backwards to expose the motor
2022-03-08 23:40:58.379 Dean:    the replacement washing machine worked for the first quick wash then stopped
2022-03-08 23:40:26.753 Dean:

2022-03-08 15:26:35.877 Dean:    
2022-03-08 15:26:31.773 Dean:    and now catching up with the washing
2022-03-08 15:26:22.678 Dean:    cleaned the spare and tested it
2022-03-08 15:26:11.405 Dean:    took it out, replaced with our spare
2022-03-08 15:25:59.471 Dean:    washing machine failed - drain error
2022-03-08 15:25:48.893 Dean:

2022-03-07 19:32:05.995 Dean:    writing them to a temporary array
2022-03-07 19:31:52.587 Dean:    I am able to identify the older filestamps and separate those out
2022-03-07 19:31:26.419 Dean:    on the FCW front, archiving is going well
2022-03-07 18:37:16.458 Dean:    Well, I will try to do so
2022-03-07 12:27:50.507 Dean:    works perfectly

2022-03-07 12:13:11.898 Dean:    you might have to add some error trapping around that bit
2022-03-07 12:12:55.947 Dean:    the battery widge t was not amongst the errors popped up
2022-03-07 12:12:05.578 Dean:    and 
2022-03-07 12:11:28.426 Dean:    use the kill feature
2022-03-07 12:11:21.587 Dean:    then restart startup mgr
2022-03-07 12:11:09.610 Dean:    I had to shutdown YWE entirely after editing the xml
2022-03-07 12:10:45.010 Dean:    it does look as if the naming in widget.xml has something to do with it
2022-03-07 12:07:10.170 Dean:    I think they have none

2022-03-07 11:49:07.346 Dean:    and at that point each of the widgets closes gracefully, one by one
2022-03-07 11:48:44.802 Dean:    then there is a pause

2022-02-19 20:11:45.698 Dean:    roast pork here
2022-02-19 19:54:59.618 Dean:    I suppose, if it works!
2022-02-19 19:54:45.969 Dean:    really?
2022-02-19 19:54:37.206 Dean:    [quote] Not sure that you understood about the green "battery". - I made it. [/quote] 
2022-02-19 19:54:08.171 Dean:    no duty
2022-02-19 19:54:05.657 Dean:    nope
2022-02-19 15:51:58.584 Dean:    and has mounting screw holes
2022-02-19 15:51:26.312 Dean:    can take power from a 5v DC source
2022-02-19 15:50:53.455 Dean:    and could go in a box nicely
2022-02-19 15:50:43.825 Dean:    and it is a proper size with components spaced out
2022-02-19 15:50:32.057 Dean:    but the one I bought has two 18650 batt holders, the nice resistor and the same circuitryas yours
2022-02-19 15:49:49.576 Dean:    it looks a nice little board
2022-02-19 15:49:03.256 Dean:    so it will survive
2022-02-19 15:48:56.464 Dean:    but not v. hot
2022-02-19 15:48:48.656 Dean:    that becomes warm
2022-02-19 15:48:34.136 Dean:    mine has a 40mm ceramic resistor
2022-02-19 15:47:52.808 Dean:    a board that small might get very hot
2022-02-19 15:47:17.969 Dean:    as I can charge/discharge simultaneously
2022-02-19 15:46:54.370 Dean:    I use a separate charger
2022-02-19 15:46:00.473 Dean:    I have two dozen of those
2022-02-19 15:45:31.032 Dean:    only usefu for old batteries from dubious sources
2022-02-19 15:45:11.313 Dean:    and tests the capability of the battery
2022-02-19 15:44:53.736 Dean:    just discharges
2022-02-19 15:44:46.968 Dean:    mine doesn't charge at all
2022-02-19 15:21:35.119 Dean:    https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/294549941551
2022-02-19 15:12:26.880 Dean:    that's ridiculous
2022-02-19 15:12:15.467 Dean:    [quote] The green one is a dummy made from 15mm copper pipe and two end caps. [/quote] 
2022-02-19 14:23:51.377 Dean:    when I pair it up with similar rated types
2022-02-19 14:23:36.449 Dean:    or as a less than stellar battery pack
2022-02-19 14:23:24.345 Dean:    for a torch or similar
2022-02-19 14:23:15.201 Dean:    So even the most useless of my 18650s has a utilisable charge
2022-02-19 14:22:38.185 Dean:    or 1058mAh
2022-02-19 14:22:03.897 Dean:    just completed the test of the worst battery and it took it from 17.58% of the the original rated capacity to  40.69%
2022-02-19 14:21:16.729 Dean:    I will find it
2022-02-19 14:08:41.993 Dean:    dusting
2022-02-19 14:08:37.465 Dean:    a light ducting of snow
2022-02-19 14:08:31.400 Dean:    
2022-02-19 14:08:18.649 Dean:    so far the batteries are giving me a far greater capacity then the first test
2022-02-19 14:07:46.616 Dean:    when I feel more confident then will be able to test those that gave a better result first time around
2022-02-19 14:07:16.634 Dean:    so,if I lose them, it does not matter
2022-02-19 14:07:06.081 Dean:    doing this on the batteries that fared the worst on the initial test
2022-02-19 14:06:40.073 Dean:    and now re-testing to a close but still safe level (then instantly recharging)
2022-02-19 14:06:18.864 Dean:    I have researched each and found the voltage
2022-02-19 14:06:06.897 Dean:    until I knew the cut off voltage of each type I possess
2022-02-19 14:05:51.345 Dean:    I have been taking the safe route andonly discharging to 3.7v
2022-02-19 14:05:28.585 Dean:    the 18650s have a cut-off voltage after which, if you dicsharge further you damage them
2022-02-19 14:05:02.241 Dean:    I am re-testing the 18650 batts I previously tested
2022-02-19 14:04:50.976 Dean:    
2022-02-19 14:04:37.522 Dean:    picture!
2022-02-19 10:01:37.424 Dean:    your journey should be fine
2022-02-19 10:01:30.592 Dean:    weather's not so bad here
2022-02-19 10:01:13.208 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-02-18 23:04:51.289 Dean:    the packs I mean
2022-02-18 23:04:40.928 Dean:    and I am getting to know these batteries and how they operate, how to disassemble &c
2022-02-18 23:04:18.090 Dean:    it is an interesting analysis as well
2022-02-18 23:03:19.897 Dean:    when I get matching sets I can create battery packs using the best capacity and simialr discharge characteristics
2022-02-18 23:02:29.753 Dean:    the others are much newer
2022-02-18 23:02:13.841 Dean:    quite old
2022-02-18 23:02:05.360 Dean:    but this is just one set from a particular laptop battery
2022-02-18 23:01:33.160 Dean:    the better ones are holding 50-60%
2022-02-18 23:01:16.120 Dean:    but all are holding at least some charge
2022-02-18 23:00:59.265 Dean:    results of testing so far is that the batteries are in varying stages of decay
2022-02-18 23:00:36.897 Dean:    
2022-02-18 23:00:08.209 Dean:    easy enough
2022-02-18 23:00:02.585 Dean:    but done now
2022-02-18 22:59:58.632 Dean:    had to figure out the instructions my self
2022-02-18 22:59:41.470 Dean:    displays in mAh or watts
2022-02-18 22:59:27.560 Dean:    the one on the right is being discharged
2022-02-18 22:59:18.017 Dean:    the battery on the left provides power
2022-02-18 22:58:59.505 Dean:    s
2022-02-18 22:58:57.378 Dean:    but till new
2022-02-18 22:58:54.072 Dean:    no box, no instructions
2022-02-18 22:58:47.305 Dean:    bought from ebay verycheaply
2022-02-18 22:45:15.618 Dean:    mine can also recharge alkaline
2022-02-18 22:44:56.944 Dean:    looks good
2022-02-18 22:43:51.521 Dean:    not in FCW
2022-02-18 22:43:35.129 Dean:    can try
2022-02-18 22:43:31.113 Dean:    An try
2022-02-18 22:13:00.209 Dean:    measures the mAh capacity for each battery
2022-02-18 22:12:33.984 Dean:    to avoid killing the battery
2022-02-18 22:12:23.383 Dean:    discharges through a nice fat resistor down to a predefined level
2022-02-18 22:11:58.832 Dean:    this is my 18650 battery tester
2022-02-18 22:11:45.170 Dean:    <><>273695185_3163148030619634_384058228777624161_n.jpg
2022-02-18 22:11:37.992 Dean:    
2022-02-18 22:11:36.992 Dean:    impressive
2022-02-18 22:11:33.526 Dean:    but they survived 28 years keeping a device running and then still revived a bit
2022-02-18 22:11:13.917 Dean:    not enough to use
2022-02-18 22:11:07.704 Dean:    I managed to coax them to 1.0 v
2022-02-18 22:10:57.633 Dean:    that revive even alkaline batteries
2022-02-18 22:10:50.264 Dean:    I put them in my clever charger
2022-02-18 22:10:40.145 Dean:    but two took a charge
2022-02-18 22:10:30.184 Dean:    and two were beyond saving
2022-02-18 22:10:18.129 Dean:    I tried charging the batteries that came with the iq9000
2022-02-18 22:07:20.764 Dean:    same here

2022-02-17 23:37:05.921 Dean:    I'd have one but I do have a real lathe already
2022-02-17 23:35:53.593 Dean:    almost worth it just for parts
2022-02-17 23:35:43.136 Dean:    a PSU, some cheap chisels, a chuck, key, motor and switch
2022-02-17 23:34:53.585 Dean:    but for £21?
2022-02-17 23:34:42.057 Dean:    I know it is tiny
2022-02-17 23:33:45.097 Dean:    as a modelling lathe it is almost perfect
2022-02-17 23:33:22.056 Dean:    That's an amazing price
2022-02-17 18:56:51.069 Dean:    and easy to use, easy to store
2022-02-17 18:56:10.846 Dean:    just a drill motor but on a good bed
2022-02-17 18:55:48.990 Dean:    but I still think those mini lathes are good value
2022-02-17 18:55:35.270 Dean:    that is a good desktop lathe of the type that might suit you for proper work

2022-02-15 23:44:17.607 Dean:    but I will check for you
2022-02-15 23:42:07.912 Dean:    if you submit the file to virustotal then you will see no known problems with the unpacked binary
2022-02-15 23:40:28.015 Dean:    so automatic flags raised
2022-02-15 23:40:16.906 Dean:    it was created using vb6
2022-02-15 23:40:04.694 Dean:    yes you would receive virus warnings about the binary
2022-02-15 22:54:30.805 Dean:    allows download from youtube
2022-02-15 22:54:20.871 Dean:    useful software written in vb6

2022-02-15 22:51:11.623 Dean:    but if it works
2022-02-15 22:51:01.710 Dean:    useful to check the reviews first
2022-02-15 22:29:33.711 Dean:    at the very least it will able to machine small items
2022-02-15 22:29:19.191 Dean:    but it might be worth buying to try and learn its features and what it does
2022-02-15 22:28:57.911 Dean:    and it is very small
2022-02-15 22:28:48.750 Dean:    do not know the quality
2022-02-15 20:27:34.560 Dean:    https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/325004846263?hash=item4babcc64b7:g:858AAOSw8lVhgRHG
2022-02-15 20:27:33.196 Dean:    
2022-02-15 20:27:33.009 Dean:    
2022-02-15 19:38:45.294 Dean:    i fthey could talk to each other then it woul dbe possible to let the main widget know that the prefs had changed
2022-02-15 19:38:12.138 Dean:    and the prefs code could be more modular
2022-02-15 19:37:56.488 Dean:    you would be able to move each separately
2022-02-15 19:33:12.173 Dean:    C
2022-02-15 19:33:09.726 Dean:    Ould the prefs be in a separate widget?
2022-02-15 19:21:14.077 Dean:    can two NW js widgets communicate?
2022-02-15 19:20:59.082 Dean:    
2022-02-15 19:20:46.233 Dean:    t
2022-02-15 19:20:45.238 Dean:    then it will loop though the lines and extract those of a certain dare
2022-02-15 19:20:10.242 Dean:    so
2022-02-15 19:20:08.648 Dean:    and if o
2022-02-15 19:20:05.874 Dean:    otherwise it will check if idle
2022-02-15 19:19:32.625 Dean:    and exit if the timestamp is already from today
2022-02-15 19:19:09.407 Dean:    I will do thye same as before and have a regular timer that checks a timestamp in the settings file
2022-02-15 19:18:40.984 Dean:    some small coding yesterday implementing the start of housekeeping
2022-02-15 19:18:23.309 Dean:    no coding today
2022-02-15 19:18:12.742 Dean:    Will test
2022-02-15 12:23:19.524 Dean:    I will do that!
2022-02-15 10:42:06.432 Dean:    and now I cannot hear a thing except squelching
2022-02-15 10:41:54.940 Dean:    wife used olive oil to improve my hearing
2022-02-15 09:40:01.684 Dean:    now cannot hear a thing
2022-02-15 09:39:56.347 Dean:    olive oil in both ears
2022-02-15 09:39:47.252 Dean:    completely deaf today
2022-02-15 09:39:30.779 Dean:    noit here anyway
2022-02-15 09:39:23.731 Dean:    except it isn't fine at all
2022-02-15 09:39:01.218 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?

2022-02-14 22:29:17.093 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-02-14 13:39:59.522 Dean:    myhead
2022-02-14 13:39:56.748 Dean:    Slow today
2022-02-14 10:47:38.875 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-02-13 23:44:07.522 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-02-13 21:12:55.981 Dean:    and testing
2022-02-13 21:12:53.508 Dean:    help and added more intervals for the advice messages
2022-02-13 21:12:34.893 Dean:    minor changes
2022-02-13 21:07:30.773 Dean:    Same here
2022-02-13 12:47:37.979 Dean:    how is SWMBO?
2022-02-13 12:47:31.243 Dean:    a little hungover today
2022-02-13 12:46:45.873 Dean:    Good Afternoon!
2022-02-12 13:18:48.696 Dean:    not like the current range
2022-02-12 13:18:42.248 Dean:    no leaks at all
2022-02-12 13:18:35.377 Dean:    I was impressed by the Energizer batteries from the 1990s
2022-02-12 11:15:13.304 Dean:    for a device from the early 90s
2022-02-12 11:15:03.536 Dean:    that is quite impressive
2022-02-12 11:14:50.817 Dean:    both the RAM card and the machine itself
2022-02-12 11:14:30.225 Dean:    that's 28 years
2022-02-12 11:14:14.512 Dean:    still had 0.09v present
2022-02-12 11:13:59.937 Dean:    none split, no corrosion
2022-02-12 11:13:47.840 Dean:    and the 4 x 1.5v Energizer batteries that were left in it
2022-02-12 11:13:25.272 Dean:    backed up by CR2032 1.5v battery all these years
2022-02-12 11:13:04.913 Dean:    data still presnt in RAM
2022-02-12 11:12:25.192 Dean:    new AAA batteries x 4
2022-02-12 11:12:12.802 Dean:    An old Sharp IQ9000 that hasn't been switched on since 94-95
2022-02-12 11:10:41.379 Dean:    <><>iq9000-1.png
2022-02-12 09:50:37.845 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-02-11 23:36:17.753 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-02-11 18:19:14.644 Dean:    good job
2022-02-11 17:56:08.308 Dean:    the trouble is with closing the lid, that you know the image underneath is still there...
2022-02-11 17:54:58.228 Dean:    it is crtainly the better option for turning on FCW and just checking the picture...
2022-02-11 17:54:18.243 Dean:    and the other picture demonstrates that female's chunky thighs
2022-02-11 17:53:55.148 Dean:    given a chance
2022-02-11 17:53:49.748 Dean:    and it looks as if the body is repairing itself
2022-02-11 17:53:33.884 Dean:    That looks much better
2022-02-11 17:53:03.083 Dean:    
2022-02-11 17:52:59.444 Dean:    hoping that is the reason and the fix
2022-02-11 17:52:51.740 Dean:    so I have added a listbox.refresh at the end
2022-02-11 17:52:33.388 Dean:    sometimes a control will not update when there is a lot of processing going on , such as that in a loop
2022-02-11 17:51:55.787 Dean:    FCW - I noticed the input box was sometimes failing to show the latest messages though the modification lamp was glowing
2022-02-11 16:26:32.827 Dean:    how's the nose?
2022-02-11 12:23:02.518 Dean:    attempting to install  XP on another desktop system later today I think
2022-02-11 12:21:58.613 Dean:    it no longer operates!
2022-02-11 12:21:53.629 Dean:    I wanted to reflow some joints 
2022-02-11 12:21:46.652 Dean:    the hot air desoldering tool on my soldering station has failed
2022-02-11 12:21:13.245 Dean:    cleaning floors, washing, dishwasher &c, the daily grind
2022-02-11 12:20:46.157 Dean:    same here
2022-02-11 12:04:50.157 Dean:    then
2022-02-11 12:04:43.710 Dean:    the attaching to the garage wall
2022-02-11 12:02:05.973 Dean:    successfully upgraded the old frakenstein e5400 to an SSD and I am mounting it on a substantial sheet of chipboard vertically
2022-02-11 12:01:04.005 Dean:    cleaned the E6410 too
2022-02-11 12:00:46.316 Dean:    Cleaned the G5 white keyboard - they really do show the muck from your fingers
2022-02-10 22:33:47.584 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-02-10 21:29:14.697 Dean:    the second will probably be a ReactOS test bed
2022-02-10 21:28:58.618 Dean:    mounted on the wall
2022-02-10 21:28:51.121 Dean:    that ius becoming my garage computer
2022-02-10 21:28:42.062 Dean:    the 1st is my old Dell e5400
2022-02-10 21:28:28.290 Dean:    and trying to get another to work
2022-02-10 21:28:21.153 Dean:    I am upgrading an old laptop
2022-02-10 21:28:10.066 Dean:    an get on with something else
2022-02-10 21:28:01.878 Dean:    makes sense to do wo
2022-02-10 20:10:02.417 Dean:    one of those days
2022-02-10 20:09:56.833 Dean:    not much going well
2022-02-10 20:09:45.160 Dean:    tough day here
2022-02-10 15:16:05.872 Dean:    so far no joy
2022-02-10 15:16:02.127 Dean:    now trying to get the GPU to work
2022-02-10 15:15:52.936 Dean:    I installed Windows XP from the CD, that bit worked
2022-02-10 13:40:48.736 Dean:    using your CD
2022-02-10 10:48:21.295 Dean:    on an old lappie
2022-02-10 10:48:13.959 Dean:    I am to try the XP install later today
2022-02-10 10:48:04.783 Dean:    
2022-02-10 10:47:57.236 Dean:    the latter feels right to me
2022-02-10 10:47:45.847 Dean:    or would you have it on a more regular hourly timer with an idle check as per the email timer?
2022-02-10 10:47:10.975 Dean:    would you have it on a daily timer, on startup or shutdown?
2022-02-10 10:46:46.079 Dean:    If I wanted to have a task performing housekeeping, scolling through the timestamps and archiving,
2022-02-10 10:46:16.127 Dean:    H.
2022-02-10 10:28:40.848 Dean:    Morning!
2022-02-09 21:06:42.182 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-02-09 21:06:39.298 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2022-02-09 21:06:35.953 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-02-09 20:57:34.219 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1939
2022-02-09 15:51:24.086 Dean:    Thankyou
2022-02-09 15:51:20.527 Dean:    Your CD just arrived!
2022-02-09 13:18:44.811 Dean:    is it possible to have context menus in NW?
2022-02-09 13:18:22.144 Dean:    re: menu - understood
2022-02-09 13:17:43.566 Dean:    others will too
2022-02-09 13:17:38.189 Dean:    coming from Windows I do have expectations that a window has a close button somewhere
2022-02-09 13:17:16.725 Dean:    it should be self-explanatory
2022-02-09 13:17:08.230 Dean:    I think a close buon would be nice just so we don't force users to have to learn something
2022-02-09 12:45:38.781 Dean:    about to implement housekeeping
2022-02-09 12:45:23.078 Dean:    FCW I have made some minor UI improvements
2022-02-09 12:43:16.886 Dean:    
2022-02-09 12:42:00.109 Dean:    Do you expect the right click menu to be a complicated affair?
2022-02-09 12:41:47.797 Dean:    
2022-02-09 12:40:59.822 Dean:    it really takes a long time to build a complicated prefs
2022-02-09 12:40:42.822 Dean:    good progress so far
2022-02-09 12:40:34.125 Dean:    I figured how to close it...
2022-02-09 12:40:12.801 Dean:     on windows we expect a X top right to close
2022-02-09 12:39:42.774 Dean:    The pres definitely need a close button
2022-02-09 12:39:08.853 Dean:    and it allows me to see the vestiges of a shadow of the button image
2022-02-09 12:38:45.453 Dean:    my background is entirely black
2022-02-09 12:38:36.598 Dean:    
2022-02-09 12:38:35.149 Dean:    I think it is the prefs buttons that the icons that sit upon
2022-02-09 12:37:53.942 Dean:    When hidden I can see some hint of a shadow where the prefs is residing
2022-02-09 12:37:18.742 Dean:    Only issue currently is:
2022-02-09 12:36:42.501 Dean:    DH I mean
2022-02-09 12:36:35.589 Dean:    tested here

2022-02-09 09:34:56.874 Dean:    Hello!
2022-02-08 21:13:24.909 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-02-08 21:13:22.407 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-02-08 19:31:37.539 Dean:    and replaced a locked tap upstairs
2022-02-08 19:31:18.218 Dean:    fitted new tap to downstairs kitchen sink
2022-02-08 19:30:09.906 Dean:    new sink in downstairs WC
2022-02-08 19:30:01.043 Dean:    plumbing here
2022-02-08 18:36:33.591 Dean:    and interpreted the xml in the way I propose
2022-02-08 18:36:16.538 Dean:    probably written  in C++
2022-02-08 18:36:03.811 Dean:    I suppose the prefs in konfab was done in the way I propose
2022-02-08 18:11:39.865 Dean:    that did not exist in Xwidget
2022-02-08 18:11:32.562 Dean:    one of the nice things about YWE was the separate windows
2022-02-08 18:11:13.459 Dean:    I imagine the prefs of each are fixed in position
2022-02-08 18:10:52.826 Dean:    are the too moveable separately?
2022-02-08 18:10:36.251 Dean:    could the prefs be a separate widget?
2022-02-08 18:10:24.802 Dean:    but it seems slightly wrong initiating a VB6 program for the prefs of a NW js widget
2022-02-08 18:09:57.474 Dean:    I could come up with a VB6 program that could do it
2022-02-08 18:09:42.714 Dean:    right
2022-02-08 17:35:29.034 Dean:    understood
2022-02-08 16:32:04.177 Dean:    if we are going to be migrating the widgets one by one it would save an awful lot of time
2022-02-08 16:31:27.626 Dean:    Perhaps that could be the next task
2022-02-08 16:31:11.817 Dean:    then build a prefs automatically
2022-02-08 16:31:04.297 Dean:    read from XML/JSON
2022-02-08 16:30:52.042 Dean:    replicate rather
2022-02-08 16:30:43.810 Dean:    That is why I am of the opinion that we duplicate what YWE does
2022-02-08 16:30:16.865 Dean:    I can see why someone in the konfab team thought it was a fundamental idea
2022-02-08 16:29:44.674 Dean:    causing it to change the prefs controls to reflect the values stored
2022-02-08 16:29:24.995 Dean:    filling the comboboxes
2022-02-08 16:28:35.257 Dean:    storing it
2022-02-08 16:28:27.426 Dean:    reading/writing/validating the data
2022-02-08 16:28:05.194 Dean:    WhenI wascreating the prefs pane in VB6 for FCW it takes as much work as the main program
2022-02-08 14:19:55.440 Dean:    yes, understood
2022-02-08 12:27:42.219 Dean:    i presume they are static?
2022-02-08 12:15:25.276 Dean:    That's nice
2022-02-08 09:33:25.731 Dean:    healing?
2022-02-08 09:33:21.021 Dean:    How's the nose?
2022-02-08 09:33:15.044 Dean:     Windspeed is 20 knots, force 5, direction SW

2022-02-07 22:19:33.748 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire

2022-02-07 16:30:32.588 Dean:    but it does seem more natural to have it in top to bottom order
2022-02-07 16:30:16.964 Dean:    on a long email it is quite useful having the latest at the top
2022-02-07 16:30:01.994 Dean:    so another step
2022-02-07 16:29:54.042 Dean:    yes a sort would do but I am not even writing it to anything other than the email body
2022-02-07 16:19:58.876 Dean:    I could write it to another array and invert that
2022-02-07 16:19:35.133 Dean:    but it would mean searching through a lot more emails
2022-02-07 16:19:20.370 Dean:    I could start at the other end of the array
2022-02-07 16:19:06.108 Dean:    that saves CPU
2022-02-07 16:19:00.568 Dean:    and I start at the top and when I find a timestamp that is older than the last email interval I don't search through any more
2022-02-07 16:18:14.480 Dean:    reason being that' the way it is in the file
2022-02-07 16:17:37.651 Dean:    I think I may leave the email latest at the top

2022-02-07 15:58:37.522 Dean:    the interval will be ignored if it thinks you have interacted with the GUI at all
2022-02-07 15:58:13.687 Dean:    all sounds good
2022-02-07 15:58:08.557 Dean:    That's expected
2022-02-07 15:49:44.003 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1933
2022-02-07 15:45:17.044 Dean:    the timer to make it go away was started too early
2022-02-07 15:44:46.996 Dean:    fixed I think
2022-02-07 15:43:43.319 Dean:    I will sort that
2022-02-07 15:43:36.659 Dean:    yes I noticed that at one point it did not disappear
2022-02-07 15:41:32.932 Dean:    the email icon should appear for no more than three-four seconds at most
2022-02-07 15:41:03.756 Dean:    the idle time is based upon user input
2022-02-07 15:40:35.404 Dean:    it should disappear when the email process is complete
2022-02-07 15:40:08.103 Dean:    to the left of the help button
2022-02-07 15:39:57.572 Dean:    next tot he help button and above the clock
2022-02-07 15:39:39.771 Dean:    FCW will show a little letter icon when it is sending an email
2022-02-07 15:39:04.811 Dean:    as archiving the input has implications
2022-02-07 15:38:50.141 Dean:    it will only archive the output file at the moment
2022-02-07 15:38:32.040 Dean:    I have added a dropdown containing a number of days after which FCW will archive, the max being 100
2022-02-07 15:38:02.964 Dean:    
2022-02-07 15:37:51.540 Dean:    I will amend it so that it writes the messages the "other way up"
2022-02-07 15:37:31.605 Dean:    you should receive these too
2022-02-07 15:37:23.434 Dean:    hopefully, with the interval set to one minute
2022-02-07 15:37:01.321 Dean:    Yes, I am not surprised
2022-02-07 15:34:45.005 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Microsoft Windows XP  Version:0.0.1933

2022-02-07 15:05:01.775 Dean:    re: DH, still one of my favourite widgets
2022-02-07 15:04:49.223 Dean:    
2022-02-07 15:04:32.778 Dean:    yet it is still doing its stuff regularly as I have the interval set at one minute
2022-02-07 15:03:55.312 Dean:    FCW - I have not noticed the emailing routine taking CPU away from the rest of the GUI since I put the idle time check in place
2022-02-07 15:00:11.845 Dean:    it generates an err pop up when dragging from elsewhere
2022-02-07 14:59:33.660 Dean:    drag and drop does its stuff from the desktop
2022-02-07 14:59:17.596 Dean:    DH is doing and operating well
2022-02-07 14:26:09.379 Dean:    then I will test and amend on Windows 10
2022-02-07 14:25:44.576 Dean:    
2022-02-07 14:25:42.206 Dean:    does it sound sufficient?
2022-02-07 14:25:25.340 Dean:    a simple enough requirement
2022-02-07 14:25:02.417 Dean:    and be named accordingly
2022-02-07 14:24:53.780 Dean:    they will go into an archive folder
2022-02-07 14:24:32.254 Dean:    I think we will have a dropdown indicating number of days beyond which any messages will be archived
2022-02-07 14:23:48.749 Dean:    now working on automatic archiving
2022-02-07 14:21:20.506 Dean:    looking good
2022-02-07 13:49:32.012 Dean:    understood
2022-02-07 13:49:28.475 Dean:    
2022-02-07 13:41:02.331 Dean:    if the app is being used then it simply exits the email routine
2022-02-07 13:40:26.455 Dean:    this should minimise any delays to the UI
2022-02-07 13:40:10.613 Dean:    FCW now checks for idle time >30 seconds before it sends out an email
2022-02-07 11:03:21.011 Dean:    I was dragging wrong folder
2022-02-07 11:03:09.913 Dean:    DH working correctly on NW
2022-02-07 10:52:42.446 Dean:    it does look good then!
2022-02-07 10:51:16.369 Dean:    t
2022-02-07 10:51:14.811 Dean:    I am free oday
2022-02-07 10:51:07.778 Dean:    keep sending me versions of DH and I will test
2022-02-07 10:50:52.863 Dean:    
2022-02-07 10:47:41.488 Dean:    and I should have XP Pro courtesy of you and some XP home CDs from a friend
2022-02-07 10:46:52.843 Dean:    I have managed to find Win 98, 2000 CDs
2022-02-07 10:46:23.420 Dean:    that will get me going again on that project
2022-02-07 10:46:11.187 Dean:    Thankyou Harry for the CD
2022-02-07 10:44:10.010 Dean:    in NW js I have a blank page
2022-02-07 10:43:56.435 Dean:    afterwards does nothing
2022-02-07 10:43:41.318 Dean:    no changes to prefs
2022-02-07 10:43:36.898 Dean:    hole - ran it first time in Firefox and it seemed to react when I dragged a file to it
2022-02-07 10:10:53.034 Dean:    brifgt sun though
2022-02-07 10:10:37.831 Dean:     Windspeed is 13 knots, force 4, direction W

2022-02-07 10:10:26.918 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-02-06 23:14:40.081 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-02-06 22:36:29.026 Dean:    very tired here
2022-02-06 22:36:25.241 Dean:    good
2022-02-06 22:19:16.105 Dean:    plumber is doing work here and I'm helping him
2022-02-06 22:19:04.626 Dean:    might be a little busy the next few days
2022-02-06 21:36:51.378 Dean:    and no user input for a while
2022-02-06 21:36:44.001 Dean:    so I may make sure it runs only when the application is idle
2022-02-06 21:36:06.809 Dean:    but it still has a 3-4 sec impact
2022-02-06 21:35:52.457 Dean:    so it runs in an asynch timer
2022-02-06 21:35:33.809 Dean:    I cannot multi-thread in VB6
2022-02-06 21:35:24.689 Dean:    it takes a little CPU during the email process
2022-02-06 21:35:11.617 Dean:    just testing the email on FCW
2022-02-06 20:20:46.906 Dean:    I am testing win7 and win10 at the mo
2022-02-06 20:20:37.241 Dean:    will move to my other machine and test there shortly
2022-02-06 20:19:44.249 Dean:    not set up to run NW at the mo
2022-02-06 20:19:29.033 Dean:    sorry, forgot to tell you that
2022-02-06 20:19:21.273 Dean:    running from the browser first
2022-02-06 20:19:11.249 Dean:    no, not yet
2022-02-06 20:07:38.208 Dean:    wpFolder: null
2022-02-06 19:11:36.320 Dean:    changing prefs
2022-02-06 19:11:13.313 Dean:    file drag and drop not registering
2022-02-06 16:40:27.395 Dean:    a significant improvement
2022-02-06 15:32:58.244 Dean:    send me a picture of something else so that doesn't pop up everytime I open the emoji covver!
2022-02-06 15:32:26.828 Dean:    let's hope it works
2022-02-06 15:32:07.375 Dean:    poor you
2022-02-06 15:31:53.947 Dean:    there's room for an umbrella in amongst that
2022-02-06 15:31:35.324 Dean:    bloody hell
2022-02-06 14:20:27.637 Dean:    testing
2022-02-06 13:02:40.710 Dean:    Understood
2022-02-06 12:25:55.557 Dean:    FCW - some minor improvements during testing
2022-02-06 12:25:33.181 Dean:    
2022-02-06 12:25:31.301 Dean:    I can almost picture it
2022-02-06 12:25:04.373 Dean:    you need a small cocktail umbrella for your nose
2022-02-06 11:25:41.487 Dean:    
2022-02-06 11:25:34.315 Dean:    then install ReactOS on it to compare
2022-02-06 11:25:23.679 Dean:    to test that laptop and drivers
2022-02-06 11:25:15.359 Dean:    I will install it on an old laptop that was designed for XP
2022-02-06 11:24:58.981 Dean:    thankyou Harry
2022-02-06 11:23:31.125 Dean:    
2022-02-06 11:23:20.555 Dean:    I have several but I have found they need to match the media
2022-02-06 11:22:49.564 Dean:    if you happen to have the key that is associated with it that would be even better
2022-02-06 11:22:26.697 Dean:    and required an update from Microsoft
2022-02-06 11:22:13.667 Dean:    mine (now gone) was SP2
2022-02-06 11:21:59.646 Dean:    the useful thing about that disc is that it is SP3
2022-02-06 11:21:42.009 Dean:    you can always have it back if you choose to ever install it again
2022-02-06 11:21:25.701 Dean:    can you please post it?
2022-02-06 11:21:18.917 Dean:    th\at is exactly what I could use
2022-02-06 11:21:07.567 Dean:    thast's perfect
2022-02-06 11:21:03.061 Dean:    bloody hell
2022-02-06 10:53:19.774 Dean:    it would just be helpful
2022-02-06 10:53:07.945 Dean:    please do
2022-02-06 10:06:16.997 Dean:    house a little cold
2022-02-06 10:06:11.988 Dean:    restored this morning
2022-02-06 10:06:02.916 Dean:    took out our electricity in the area
2022-02-06 10:05:52.652 Dean:    there was a blowy wind last night
2022-02-06 10:05:34.429 Dean:    up bright and early this morning
2022-02-06 10:05:12.620 Dean:    Morning!
2022-02-06 00:03:39.237 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-02-06 00:03:31.824 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-02-05 22:55:49.589 Dean:    all valid
2022-02-05 22:55:45.899 Dean:    I have several keys
2022-02-05 22:55:37.726 Dean:    and prefer to find a SP3 XP pro installation disc
2022-02-05 22:55:21.311 Dean:    I do not trust the ISOs that you can download on the web
2022-02-05 22:54:58.897 Dean:    that's the only one I need at the moment
2022-02-05 22:54:34.733 Dean:    Do you happen to have an XP Pro installation disc ?
2022-02-05 22:07:22.954 Dean:    I did save the keys though, thank goodness
2022-02-05 22:07:11.646 Dean:    I need to install XP and I don't have an XP SP3 disc any more
2022-02-05 22:06:43.084 Dean:    all in the bin!
2022-02-05 22:06:39.001 Dean:    all with licence keys
2022-02-05 22:06:33.481 Dean:    all my CDs from Win 3.11, 95, 98, 2000, NT 4, XP, home and Pro, 32 and 64bit Win7 pro 64 bit
2022-02-05 22:05:42.346 Dean:    threw
2022-02-05 22:05:37.457 Dean:    Did I tell you that Lucy, in a fit of pique (and tidying) through away all my licenced copies of my Windows software?
2022-02-05 22:04:52.154 Dean:    all good here
2022-02-05 22:04:45.419 Dean:    
2022-02-05 19:33:06.161 Dean:    it should now be sending any error messages that have been written to the log since the last email too
2022-02-05 19:15:10.707 Dean:    all working as planned
2022-02-05 18:58:45.001 Dean:    send me a random text pls every min. or so
2022-02-05 18:26:01.089 Dean:    
2022-02-05 18:25:55.073 Dean:    and that allows me to do the same trawl through the log for recent errors to email
2022-02-05 18:25:33.656 Dean:    FCW - I have added timestamps to the debuglog
2022-02-05 18:24:54.632 Dean:    
2022-02-05 18:24:53.424 Dean:    a significant migration?
2022-02-05 18:24:41.153 Dean:    in the end, how different will it be from the YWE .js version?
2022-02-05 18:24:13.073 Dean:    you are making good progress on the 'hole'
2022-02-05 18:23:54.313 Dean:    
2022-02-05 18:16:11.776 Dean:    send me a text or two from time to time please
2022-02-05 18:10:03.953 Dean:    the code to prevent duplicates seems to be doing its job too
2022-02-05 18:09:37.425 Dean:    some testing to do in real life but it seems to be doing its job
2022-02-05 18:09:07.185 Dean:    and it is emailing me all your recent chat texts since the last email at a set interval
2022-02-05 18:08:18.033 Dean:    the bug in calculating the number of secs since the last email has now been resolved
2022-02-05 18:07:34.681 Dean:    re: FCW 
2022-02-05 18:07:05.910 Dean:    
2022-02-05 18:07:01.577 Dean:    Do they know why it would not heal?
2022-02-05 18:03:07.545 Dean:    good progress on both nose and desktop hole
2022-02-05 17:18:59.576 Dean:    what did they do to the nose?
2022-02-05 15:33:55.491 Dean:    
2022-02-05 15:33:10.024 Dean:    with a timestamp
2022-02-05 15:33:05.384 Dean:    I've added some simple debug logging to an output file in the app.dir
2022-02-05 15:32:43.853 Dean:    
2022-02-05 12:26:22.422 Dean:    strange how they might assume that all files are being dropped from the desktop when such things as file explorers clealry exist
2022-02-05 12:25:48.055 Dean:    looks as if you have made lots of progress on the desktop hole
2022-02-05 12:25:20.967 Dean:    good luck!
2022-02-05 12:25:15.895 Dean:    Hopefully they sort your nose
2022-02-05 12:23:58.751 Dean:    oops

2022-02-02 20:12:52.480 Dean:    so it felt longer
2022-02-02 20:12:48.056 Dean:    near the coast
2022-02-02 20:12:40.625 Dean:    it was in the cold and rain against a driving wind
2022-02-02 20:12:25.613 Dean:    still a little tired

2022-02-01 15:18:11.823 Dean:    sunny here
2022-02-01 15:17:57.498 Dean:    yes
2022-02-01 14:07:28.766 Dean:    could that not have been implemented as a layer of some sort?
2022-02-01 14:07:11.733 Dean:    YEs, there are going to have to be new ways of doing things
2022-02-01 14:06:47.931 Dean:    or rather I don't :)
2022-02-01 14:06:40.560 Dean:    I see
2022-02-01 12:21:11.296 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2022-02-01 12:21:01.089 Dean:    will test

2022-01-31 22:43:52.504 Dean:    hoping so
2022-01-31 22:43:34.644 Dean:    Are you alright?
2022-01-31 22:43:24.967 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-01-31 21:50:16.458 Dean:    testing FCW with longer intervals between emails
2022-01-31 21:49:53.758 Dean:    off to bed soon
2022-01-31 20:32:43.307 Dean:    The timers are working to the correct interval
2022-01-31 19:47:23.385 Dean:    all going well
2022-01-31 19:01:42.540 Dean:    as there are two different timers
2022-01-31 19:01:33.839 Dean:    I am testing FCW in IDE and without
2022-01-31 19:01:21.588 Dean:    
2022-01-31 18:57:12.699 Dean:    understood

2022-01-31 18:16:19.852 Dean:    I just now need it to email the right stuff 
2022-01-31 18:16:02.912 Dean:    FCW is emailing regularly
2022-01-31 18:15:27.898 Dean:    yup
2022-01-31 18:12:56.999 Dean:    I like it
2022-01-31 16:53:16.941 Dean:    FCW testing the sending of email from the main form after making changes that will allow the timer to send an email
2022-01-31 16:52:25.821 Dean:    
2022-01-31 14:41:35.540 Dean:    the legends are all in chinese and no instructions so I am figuring each button/function out
2022-01-31 14:41:06.139 Dean:    so, I will test all mine, then recharge them, knowing the true handling values and discharge rates too
2022-01-31 14:40:07.264 Dean:    and it works by discharging the batteries at a predictable rate through a large ceramic resistor
2022-01-31 14:39:36.472 Dean:    ranging down to 2000mAh
2022-01-31 14:39:26.333 Dean:    the batteries I have a re 3400mah max.
2022-01-31 14:39:12.961 Dean:    it is an 18650 battery tester
2022-01-31 14:39:04.885 Dean:    A battery tested I ordered from china has arrived and I am using it
2022-01-31 14:38:44.031 Dean:    
2022-01-31 14:38:33.414 Dean:    regardless, it is handled
2022-01-31 14:37:55.374 Dean:    I have added some text to the messgae to determine whether it came from the input or output processing
2022-01-31 14:36:57.860 Dean:    
2022-01-31 14:22:43.662 Dean:    dealt
2022-01-31 14:22:40.773 Dean:    The fix that I did yesterday to prevent duplication just popped up  message saying it had run and delt with it
2022-01-31 13:49:36.309 Dean:    testing with win10 shortly
2022-01-31 13:02:59.960 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1887

2022-01-31 12:46:50.011 Dean:    that generate unexpected behaviour
2022-01-31 12:46:40.442 Dean:    there will be small uses cases like that from time to time I have no doubt
2022-01-31 12:46:06.005 Dean:    fixed
2022-01-31 12:46:02.502 Dean:    when in focus elsewhere, pressing RETURN set focus to the text box but added a CRLF to the beginning of the next line you type in
2022-01-31 12:44:44.636 Dean:    and directing that to the input box
2022-01-31 12:44:33.445 Dean:    it is related to capturing a keypress when focussed anywhere else on the form
2022-01-31 12:44:10.725 Dean:    That issue is now fixed
2022-01-31 12:36:11.612 Dean:    strangely enough I was thinking abut that only this morning
2022-01-31 12:35:53.848 Dean:    it is sending a CRLF through if the output win has focus and I press RETURN
2022-01-31 12:34:30.901 Dean:    Ah! I know why now
2022-01-31 12:34:18.816 Dean:    that is most strange
2022-01-31 12:33:44.854 Dean:    and I will be able to see if it happens again
2022-01-31 12:33:21.548 Dean:    I will keep the output file open in the editor
2022-01-31 12:32:28.821 Dean:    I don't know HOW that could have happened
2022-01-31 12:15:29.700 Dean:    or just the layer below
2022-01-31 12:15:16.206 Dean:    potentially
2022-01-31 11:57:56.973 Dean:    a clipping image sounds like what I thought up but it would need to be shaped in order to be useful and it would need to extend to all layers below not just the one layer it was associated with
2022-01-31 11:25:10.404 Dean:    but as far as I know there is no transparent mask that acts as a true 'hole' on anything you place it over, in the context of a GUI with layers
2022-01-31 11:24:23.748 Dean:    and there is a mask for all PNGs to appear transparent
2022-01-31 11:23:53.405 Dean:    I know it is in place to make a specific background colour transparent
2022-01-31 11:23:34.860 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:23:33.573 Dean:    or has that concept been done already?
2022-01-31 11:23:09.523 Dean:    Have I just invented something?
2022-01-31 11:23:01.796 Dean:    they would be very useful
2022-01-31 11:22:56.245 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:22:48.180 Dean:    without needing that "transparent mask" that does not yet exist
2022-01-31 11:22:26.037 Dean:    The actual desktop hole widget was almost but not quite big enough to allow that cog to rotate
2022-01-31 11:21:43.597 Dean:    did I describe it correctly?
2022-01-31 11:21:29.301 Dean:    did that make sense?
2022-01-31 11:21:11.445 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:21:02.628 Dean:    we would be able to make that cog at that level rotate
2022-01-31 11:20:47.708 Dean:    and that transparency would carry onto making the dektop click-through too
2022-01-31 11:20:18.693 Dean:    to cover the bottom 60% as shown
2022-01-31 11:20:01.149 Dean:    but if a transparent mask could be sited one level on top of it 
2022-01-31 11:19:37.180 Dean:    so cannot rotate
2022-01-31 11:19:32.404 Dean:    it is just a part of the flat image
2022-01-31 11:19:22.092 Dean:    for example the other bigger cog
2022-01-31 11:19:05.588 Dean:    I have never found that concept anywhere
2022-01-31 11:18:44.340 Dean:    masks that can impose a transparency through to the desktop on any underlying image
2022-01-31 11:18:16.260 Dean:    One thing no-one has ever thought about is transparent masks
2022-01-31 11:17:52.948 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:16:24.452 Dean:    it looks just like the 'real' thing
2022-01-31 11:16:00.748 Dean:    much better
2022-01-31 11:15:02.283 Dean:    to
2022-01-31 11:15:00.627 Dean:    just about too
2022-01-31 11:14:52.724 Dean:    desktop hole?
2022-01-31 11:14:43.163 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:14:40.460 Dean:    but can you see an occasion where an email could be snet containing both sides of the conversation?
2022-01-31 11:14:11.461 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:14:08.292 Dean:    so he won't be posting any posts himself
2022-01-31 11:13:54.828 Dean:    or away from the PC
2022-01-31 11:13:47.852 Dean:    I had thought of it as being a way to receive emails when the user is on holiday
2022-01-31 11:13:27.148 Dean:    is there any point in including the output file contents as well in that email?
2022-01-31 11:12:19.548 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:12:13.844 Dean:    just a thought
2022-01-31 11:12:10.485 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:12:07.124 Dean:    I already have code for that test somewhere
2022-01-31 11:11:55.861 Dean:    implying that the user is away
2022-01-31 11:11:41.869 Dean:    might only run it if the app has received no user input for 10 mins or so
2022-01-31 11:11:06.988 Dean:    With that code I will try to keep it as tight as possible to minimise the overhead
2022-01-31 11:10:33.289 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:10:15.588 Dean:    weasther here is alright but overcast, no sun to speak of
2022-01-31 11:09:48.898 Dean:    
2022-01-31 11:04:32.228 Dean:    is that overly complicated?

2022-01-30 23:04:52.392 Dean:    otherwise the realistic effect is lost.
2022-01-30 23:04:37.837 Dean:    that  is essential
2022-01-30 23:04:13.825 Dean:    the shadow MUST spin!
2022-01-30 21:54:57.702 Dean:    the answer can wait until tomorrow
2022-01-30 21:54:29.854 Dean:    is each rotation amount smaller?
2022-01-30 21:53:36.118 Dean:    desktop hole web widget, the animation of the wheel seems smoother
2022-01-30 21:16:58.352 Dean:    isn't that always the way?
2022-01-30 21:16:48.260 Dean:    [quote] More time wasted than actual work done! [/quote] 
2022-01-30 21:16:43.262 Dean:    understood
2022-01-30 20:57:52.526 Dean:    seems a lot more complex than a simple Ywidget
2022-01-30 20:57:34.630 Dean:    was that a fair bit of work and testing?
2022-01-30 20:57:24.559 Dean:    I quite understand
2022-01-30 20:52:12.718 Dean:    a few more bugs to go
2022-01-30 20:52:03.302 Dean:    but it seems to be doing the job it was designed for
2022-01-30 20:51:46.446 Dean:    we shall see
2022-01-30 20:51:42.455 Dean:    I may have improved FCW's performance too
2022-01-30 20:51:25.174 Dean:    
2022-01-30 20:50:37.142 Dean:    looking good
2022-01-30 20:50:08.238 Dean:    perfect
2022-01-30 20:44:00.199 Dean:    desktop hole tested in Palemoon and is rotating well but the clamping  'arm' with the ruby is no longer on top of the cog
2022-01-30 20:41:42.247 Dean:    then I will send new exe
2022-01-30 20:41:35.273 Dean:    and the fixes for that
2022-01-30 20:41:28.127 Dean:    some testing to do now on Win10
2022-01-30 20:41:09.494 Dean:    new version on the way
2022-01-30 20:41:03.391 Dean:    if it does happen then just let me know
2022-01-30 20:40:53.855 Dean:    so no duplication will occur
2022-01-30 20:40:43.550 Dean:    then handle it
2022-01-30 20:40:37.382 Dean:    if it occurs where I think it used to occur, it will pop up a little error message
2022-01-30 20:40:08.775 Dean:    I have made some changes that I hope will remove the duplication issue
2022-01-30 20:39:47.446 Dean:    testing FCW
2022-01-30 20:37:28.502 Dean:    will test
2022-01-30 20:37:24.345 Dean:    righto
2022-01-30 17:16:57.648 Dean:    working on the duplication issue
2022-01-30 17:16:44.808 Dean:    good
2022-01-30 15:01:42.095 Dean:    strange how a fix just comes to you when you separate your mind from the issue for a while
2022-01-30 15:01:15.056 Dean:    I should have that resolved soon enough
2022-01-30 15:01:02.983 Dean:    it is a fairly easy fix
2022-01-30 15:00:57.063 Dean:    I have figured out a fix for the duplication issues on FCW
2022-01-30 15:00:40.448 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:59.127 Dean:    I asked him if after all this time, any of the source code might be 'available'
2022-01-30 14:40:40.703 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    Dave
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    Regards,
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    You've made my day - I'm so happy to hear from you.
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    I still know of some loose threads to pull on to perhaps retrieve source code but I've honestly never seen it.  Chances are very slim.  To my knowledge, it was lost when migrating from Perforce to Subversion.  But that was before my time on the team.
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    I was definitely the last person ever hired to work on Yahoo Widgets proper.  You two are certainly the last remaining developers.  
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    So much has changed for me since we last spoke, professionally, personally and globally.  I am blown away; honestly, it is inspiring.
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    I would be more than happy to help out in anyway possible.  It fills me with tremendous joy you guys are still out there working on Widgets.
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    It’s probably slightly more appropriate to reach out to you with this personal e-mail. 
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    
2022-01-30 14:40:24.943 Dean:    Dean,
2022-01-30 14:40:20.031 Dean:    email from Dave Rice
2022-01-30 14:40:13.071 Dean:    
2022-01-30 13:02:59.862 Dean:    those are the recent changes
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' replace sendSomething with a call to a routine just to populate the array for multiple items to avoid the ADO file write error 3004
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' add a combobox dropdown to the smtp server section that allows selection of smtp configs
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' lifted lid image on the main screen created and implemented on a catch click and a ballon tooltip
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' gaps around the prefs borders sorted, moved prefs r/h buttons too
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    '   whose keydown even is captured with a keyAsciii = 0
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' sound combobox now has the option to state "no audio devices found" restored by changing the dropdown to a combobox
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' when a system has no sound options we need to populate the combobox text with an option of "no recording devices found"
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' F5 causing a problem after a refresh.
2022-01-30 13:02:49.860 Dean:    ' add a quotation menu option on the top menu
2022-01-30 11:30:33.773 Dean:    and it is fine
2022-01-30 11:30:29.548 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-01-30 11:30:25.344 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-01-30 11:28:39.371 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1883
2022-01-29 23:47:09.914 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-01-29 23:47:05.471 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-01-29 23:46:54.591 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-01-29 23:44:55.064 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2022-01-29 23:30:43.482 Dean:    so sad when people/companies abandon good work and then stifle it and ultimately lose the source
2022-01-29 23:30:08.242 Dean:    xwidget was almost good
2022-01-29 23:23:21.279 Dean:    K. really was a work of art wasn't it?
2022-01-29 22:18:38.663 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin Help.html
2022-01-29 21:04:56.871 Dean:    have you seen any improvements?
2022-01-29 21:04:47.697 Dean:    in the last few years since your investigations, where these .js frameworks have been developeddeveloped
2022-01-29 20:46:55.580 Dean:    Pleased to be making progress though
2022-01-29 20:46:28.969 Dean:    no native multi threading in VB6 so we will see what the impact is of sending a regular email
2022-01-29 20:45:53.405 Dean:    and see what the impact is
2022-01-29 20:45:42.757 Dean:    but I can implement the email functionality now on a regular basis
2022-01-29 20:45:21.908 Dean:    and a task for later
2022-01-29 20:45:16.759 Dean:    so I have a workaround
2022-01-29 20:45:11.474 Dean:    and as yet it confuses me
2022-01-29 20:45:04.145 Dean:    The method exists but I have to understand it
2022-01-29 20:44:42.128 Dean:    and cannot sit in a shared code module
2022-01-29 20:44:30.435 Dean:    they are event driven routines that require a form to operate within
2022-01-29 20:44:05.439 Dean:    imperfect
2022-01-29 20:43:55.955 Dean:    but I have simply duplicated four small functions within the prefs form and inserted the duplicates in the main program
2022-01-29 20:42:56.385 Dean:    I have not implemented in the correct fashion
2022-01-29 20:42:42.195 Dean:    The email functionailty is working well  in FCW
2022-01-29 20:23:21.442 Dean:    pleased at that
2022-01-29 19:39:46.430 Dean:    remind me to come visiting at the weekend
2022-01-29 19:15:18.585 Dean:    on FCW
2022-01-29 19:15:00.621 Dean:    email is now operational from the main form
2022-01-29 18:54:52.113 Dean:    always cottage pie on Saturday?
2022-01-29 18:54:30.722 Dean:    sn important detail
2022-01-29 18:54:09.429 Dean:    shadow too
2022-01-29 18:53:43.696 Dean:    I see the difference!
2022-01-29 18:38:43.835 Dean:    I've made a little progress though
2022-01-29 18:38:24.872 Dean:    SAME HERE!
2022-01-29 18:38:15.421 Dean:    [quote] Been trying to progress Desktop Hole but had too many distractions. [/quote] 
2022-01-29 10:44:42.079 Dean:    have to finish these first
2022-01-29 10:44:07.254 Dean:    I think my next project will be a prefs creator
2022-01-29 10:43:41.791 Dean:    as long as they provide at least some of what the the old YWE did by default
2022-01-29 10:43:22.550 Dean:    with some help from these frameworks
2022-01-29 10:43:13.542 Dean:    the web widgets have to be the way forward
2022-01-29 10:42:36.091 Dean:    lovely seeing the desktop hole on the browser
2022-01-29 10:42:07.318 Dean:    not wet here
2022-01-29 09:29:18.624 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-01-28 21:10:44.703 Dean:    then I can make it email!  - not just as a test in the prefs
2022-01-28 21:10:21.832 Dean:    so it can be utilised in either form
2022-01-28 21:10:10.794 Dean:    so that I can move the current email code to a publically shared module
2022-01-28 21:09:25.262 Dean:    tomorrow I aim to make the changes to FCW to allow the email vars to respond to events using the withEvents clause
2022-01-28 18:12:44.646 Dean:    thanks for the college of Arms link
2022-01-28 18:09:57.078 Dean:    understood
2022-01-28 17:52:18.751 Dean:    it doesn't show
2022-01-28 17:52:08.510 Dean:    firefox nothing
2022-01-28 17:39:52.462 Dean:    working well
2022-01-28 17:10:55.461 Dean:    inPalemoon, when I drag a file from the desktop, it responds with a ding
2022-01-28 17:09:38.568 Dean:    it looks good
2022-01-28 17:06:53.440 Dean:    or using nw js?
2022-01-28 17:06:36.518 Dean:    you just want it run in a browser?
2022-01-28 16:00:19.999 Dean:    
2022-01-28 15:35:25.360 Dean:    the coding is the small part
2022-01-28 15:35:17.950 Dean:    and debug
2022-01-28 15:35:14.437 Dean:    you need hours just to think about and research
2022-01-28 15:18:41.886 Dean:    the trouble is with this game that a few minutes is really nothing
2022-01-28 15:18:21.333 Dean:    including some coding
2022-01-28 15:18:14.853 Dean:    to do what I want to do
2022-01-28 15:18:05.782 Dean:    and found some time
2022-01-28 15:18:01.829 Dean:    This week I have manged to recover my place in the world a little bit
2022-01-28 15:17:44.621 Dean:    
2022-01-28 15:17:33.620 Dean:    it has been a very good learning process though
2022-01-28 15:17:17.573 Dean:    with several bugs introduced
2022-01-28 15:17:07.197 Dean:    and each bug opened a new layer of functionality that had to be adopted
2022-01-28 15:16:42.294 Dean:    and then possibly less than that
2022-01-28 15:16:34.861 Dean:    I was reduced to one bug per day
2022-01-28 15:16:23.758 Dean:    Time has been so short
2022-01-28 14:38:16.941 Dean:    I feel as if I am finishing off FCW
2022-01-28 14:24:16.197 Dean:    <o><o>1F602 FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY
2022-01-28 14:10:42.037 Dean:    and I am hoping we won't see that error except in extreme circumstances
2022-01-28 14:10:02.094 Dean:    this method is less cpu usage and less file i/o too
2022-01-28 14:09:35.573 Dean:    or perhaps Dropbox getting its knickers in a twist
2022-01-28 14:09:22.749 Dean:    as it onlyhappens when Dropbox is slow to synch due to network congestion or resources in contention
2022-01-28 14:08:47.742 Dean:    the file write error is difficult to reproduce
2022-01-28 14:08:29.254 Dean:    the new method seems tp be working

2022-01-28 11:18:24.909 Dean:    s
2022-01-28 11:18:23.180 Dean:    and the serious issue will have gone
2022-01-28 11:18:16.012 Dean:    I just have that occasional duplication bug to resolve
2022-01-28 11:17:31.598 Dean:    
2022-01-28 11:17:28.899 Dean:    just need to set to it

2022-01-28 11:17:16.229 Dean:    so the chances of that occurrence should diminish
2022-01-28 11:16:56.937 Dean:    but the file write will only be done once
2022-01-28 11:16:46.296 Dean:    the array writing will occur line by line as before
2022-01-28 11:16:31.083 Dean:    and the writing of the file
2022-01-28 11:16:21.828 Dean:    so I am separating out the writing to the output file array
2022-01-28 11:16:00.760 Dean:    occasionally the process goes too slowly and the next write comes along and finds the file still open or locked
2022-01-28 11:15:31.441 Dean:    at the moment I am breaking multiline pastes into individual lines and then passing them through the routine to send them as an individual line, writing the outputfilearray and then writing the file, opening and closing for each line
2022-01-28 11:14:16.071 Dean:    on the FCW file write error I have a potential workaround figured out
2022-01-28 11:13:57.331 Dean:    
2022-01-28 10:43:26.521 Dean:    Added tooltip help tot he lid
2022-01-28 10:33:19.791 Dean:    now fixed
2022-01-28 10:33:09.930 Dean:    caused by help and other windows passing over it
2022-01-28 10:32:55.417 Dean:    some tearing on the emoji image sometimes has been cured
2022-01-28 10:32:14.007 Dean:    minor debugging
2022-01-28 09:35:01.074 Dean:     Windspeed is 8 knots, force 3, direction W
2022-01-28 09:35:01.027 Dean:     
2022-01-28 09:35:00.980 Dean:     Humidity: 93 % 
2022-01-28 09:35:00.933 Dean:     Temperature: 4.00 C

2022-01-28 09:35:00.793 Dean:     Thu Jan 27 2022 22:50:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time) 
2022-01-28 09:34:50.121 Dean:    Morning!
2022-01-28 09:34:47.093 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-01-27 22:56:51.699 Dean:    <r><r>0520220127225650mer.wav (5secs) 
2022-01-27 22:55:00.996 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-01-27 22:54:56.238 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-01-27 18:39:19.619 Dean:    absolutely, it has to be a functioning thing not just a thing to look at
2022-01-27 17:37:21.643 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:37:13.993 Dean:    not eaten salad for a while now
2022-01-27 17:37:01.276 Dean:    salad especially
2022-01-27 17:36:56.720 Dean:    pizza and salad sounds good
2022-01-27 17:36:48.685 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:36:41.804 Dean:    we might have to resurrect something like that old speedfan code if we wanted to do the same in C
2022-01-27 17:36:11.091 Dean:    I could do that in VB6 easily enough
2022-01-27 17:35:51.712 Dean:    I assume that we will have to write a small stub program like we did for speedfan in C to obtain system-level information if we want to extract cpu/memory utilisation is semi real time
2022-01-27 17:34:56.034 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:34:54.894 Dean:    as it is more than just a clock and must be usable at desktop level
2022-01-27 17:34:32.753 Dean:    I think the desktop hole will be a good proof of concept
2022-01-27 17:34:13.464 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:33:51.384 Dean:    he must intercept certain calls and redirect those to the APIs he designed
2022-01-27 17:33:20.504 Dean:    and Rain Widgets uses Chrome
2022-01-27 17:33:06.382 Dean:    xwidget and its use of the ie/Trident engine was better placed to succeed
2022-01-27 17:32:35.280 Dean:    adapting a tool that was not designed for the job probably
2022-01-27 17:32:11.062 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:31:57.426 Dean:    spaghetti bolognese here
2022-01-27 17:31:48.796 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:31:47.673 Dean:    it seems to just 'work'
2022-01-27 17:31:36.734 Dean:    it looks better in reality than it does there
2022-01-27 17:30:58.035 Dean:    it just gives you something to click upon to close the lid
2022-01-27 17:30:44.410 Dean:    so when you click on the brass ring pull the lifd raises (no animation)
2022-01-27 17:30:14.780 Dean:    there is a trial representation of an open 'lid'
2022-01-27 17:29:56.769 Dean:    and zoom in there
2022-01-27 17:29:47.874 Dean:    if you look at the control box bottom right on that image
2022-01-27 17:29:27.544 Dean:    <><>FCWMainLidOpen.png
2022-01-27 17:27:35.630 Dean:    silly sods
2022-01-27 17:27:28.281 Dean:    if you want to develop for the desktop you need to provide the same level of  access at least
2022-01-27 17:26:48.176 Dean:    and make no extensions whatsoever
2022-01-27 17:26:32.244 Dean:    to obtain access to those resources, otherwise just run in the browser
2022-01-27 17:26:14.143 Dean:    that should be the whole point
2022-01-27 17:26:04.031 Dean:    why should anyone want security when accessing web apps via the desktop?
2022-01-27 17:25:37.098 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:22:35.862 Dean:    These frameworks seem to be missing some essentials
2022-01-27 17:22:21.022 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:22:06.800 Dean:    sounds good
2022-01-27 17:21:33.074 Dean:    [quote] Used to get it regularly in the Senior Common Room when I worked in Edinburgh. [/quote]
2022-01-27 17:21:23.619 Dean:    I've had it deep fried and battered
2022-01-27 17:21:06.985 Dean:
2022-01-27 17:20:10.514 Dean:    web widget first then I assume NW js conversion to use the APIs it has ?
2022-01-27 17:19:40.301 Dean:    good progress on the dekstop hole
2022-01-27 17:19:30.780 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:18:59.883 Dean:    neeps and tatties and piped in with bagpipe music via an iphone
2022-01-27 17:18:31.149 Dean:    with whisky sauce
2022-01-27 17:18:21.117 Dean:    The haggis, by the way, was most agreeable
2022-01-27 17:18:08.993 Dean:    
2022-01-27 17:16:46.056 Dean:    agreed
2022-01-27 17:16:42.435 Dean:    [quote] Which is far too clever by half. [/quote] 
2022-01-27 12:12:07.695 Dean:    sounds like a good approach
2022-01-27 10:12:07.454 Dean:    All's well herer
2022-01-27 10:11:29.283 Dean:    Morning!
2022-01-26 21:20:01.281 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-01-26 16:45:30.181 Dean:    what's a weed hatch? an opening to clear weeds from an inlet of some sort?
2022-01-26 15:24:17.125 Dean:    
2022-01-26 15:24:11.237 Dean:    to go with the haggis  we ought to have had yeesterday
2022-01-26 15:23:54.730 Dean:    went shopping for neeps and tatties
2022-01-26 15:23:44.093 Dean:    cycle ride some way to the north coast of Norfolk
2022-01-26 15:23:25.385 Dean:    
2022-01-26 15:23:23.779 Dean:    on FCW
2022-01-26 15:23:21.142 Dean:    small coding changes
2022-01-26 15:22:51.572 Dean:    and now I have one
2022-01-26 15:22:46.758 Dean:    I always wanted one
2022-01-26 15:22:25.486 Dean:    or a generator and power some low wattage bulbs for nothing more than fun
2022-01-26 15:21:44.893 Dean:    and pump water from the river for the garden in Summer
2022-01-26 15:21:29.269 Dean:    I will find a pump
2022-01-26 15:21:20.757 Dean:    the Lister is the simplest stationary engine I could find
2022-01-26 15:21:06.013 Dean:    
2022-01-26 15:21:02.701 Dean:    and damages materials
2022-01-26 15:20:53.349 Dean:    it strips protective coatings
2022-01-26 15:20:41.711 Dean:    cavitation is a bugger
2022-01-26 12:17:23.548 Dean:    I bought that
2022-01-26 11:12:58.703 Dean:    <><>272114203_324689302999562_8500587084674559837_n.jpg
2022-01-26 11:10:28.564 Dean:    lots to do as always
2022-01-26 10:26:05.940 Dean:    just got back frtom dropping off Mum
2022-01-26 10:25:51.979 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-01-26 10:25:49.426 Dean:    all well?
2022-01-25 21:05:40.478 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-01-25 21:05:36.841 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-01-25 17:55:36.520 Dean:    quite a lot to do just to get a "hello world"
2022-01-25 17:49:53.231 Dean:    There is another called ReactJs
2022-01-25 14:34:52.392 Dean:    no rain!
2022-01-25 10:41:53.793 Dean:    Morning!
2022-01-24 20:44:45.113 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-01-24 20:44:40.393 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-01-24 20:44:34.824 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2022-01-24 20:44:28.481 Dean:    w
2022-01-24 20:44:27.058 Dean:    I may have some good nes on mum's care soon
2022-01-24 20:44:16.481 Dean:    
2022-01-24 20:44:14.865 Dean:    take care on your journey tomorrow
2022-01-24 20:44:06.234 Dean:    
2022-01-24 20:43:50.026 Dean:    it will cure the file write problem
2022-01-24 20:43:38.793 Dean:    rather than updating each line and going through the whole process multiple times
2022-01-24 20:43:12.450 Dean:    working on the file 30004 error tomorrow, thinking abou tht eimproved logic of bundling up multiple cut and pastes
2022-01-24 18:49:12.002 Dean:    small bug fixed
2022-01-24 18:49:07.922 Dean:    
2022-01-24 18:18:28.345 Dean:    that I will tell you about when it happens
2022-01-24 18:18:16.633 Dean:    I have soimething interesting coming up
2022-01-24 18:18:08.092 Dean:    
2022-01-24 17:40:07.857 Dean:    washing machine runs through all the daylight hours
2022-01-24 17:39:54.882 Dean:    apart from that I'm doing mounds of washing and drying
2022-01-24 17:31:16.921 Dean:    for my electric bike
2022-01-24 17:31:10.937 Dean:    
2022-01-24 17:31:04.017 Dean:    using that to subsides some parts I want to buy
2022-01-24 17:30:45.053 Dean:    hoping for £150
2022-01-24 17:30:36.745 Dean:    making  them look good for the sale on ebay
2022-01-24 17:30:21.481 Dean:    I have polished up a load of electric bike spare parts which I am going to sell 
2022-01-24 17:29:58.271 Dean:    interesting? not really.
2022-01-24 17:29:48.377 Dean:    
2022-01-24 17:29:40.469 Dean:    and with no knowledge of it nor pain
2022-01-24 17:29:29.649 Dean:    fit as a fiddle
2022-01-24 17:29:25.449 Dean:    but I have to say, that is the way I would like to go
2022-01-24 17:29:05.881 Dean:    I'm sorry to hear that
2022-01-24 13:29:00.834 Dean:    but at least not raining
2022-01-24 13:28:51.015 Dean:    feels it
2022-01-24 13:28:48.699 Dean:    cold here
2022-01-24 13:28:39.070 Dean:    to fix a specific bug
2022-01-24 13:28:33.513 Dean:    going to try and do some coding in VB6 today
2022-01-24 09:07:17.055 Dean:    Morning!
2022-01-23 21:42:21.093 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-01-23 18:38:36.546 Dean:    some of the names, solenoids
2022-01-23 18:37:46.883 Dean:    g
2022-01-23 18:37:44.810 Dean:    still a food watch
2022-01-23 18:37:38.858 Dean:    and visuals
2022-01-23 18:37:33.516 Dean:    as background sound
2022-01-23 18:37:14.523 Dean:    watching : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q124C7W0WYA
2022-01-23 18:37:08.906 Dean:    
2022-01-23 18:36:56.424 Dean:    not tried it
2022-01-23 18:36:50.416 Dean:    that builds a slider control of some sort?
2022-01-23 16:59:57.783 Dean:    and I don't need another project!
2022-01-23 16:59:47.710 Dean:    and become another project in itself
2022-01-23 16:59:33.273 Dean:    but I think it might be fairly complex to do
2022-01-23 16:29:22.373 Dean:    I wanted to build a tool that read the XML and built a prefs program for VB6
2022-01-23 15:55:37.463 Dean:    then add the functionality to read/write the prefs as I do in VB6
2022-01-23 15:55:15.864 Dean:    when it comes to prefs it might seem sensible to build a prefs app that reads from a .kon and create a nw prefs in a separate window...
2022-01-23 15:45:02.290 Dean:    that is the best approach and it works well for us
2022-01-23 15:16:28.551 Dean:    so, as long as a widget does all positioning by code it can be fairly easily migrated
2022-01-23 15:15:55.487 Dean:    scuse typos, cold hands
2022-01-23 15:15:47.590 Dean:    mind
2022-01-23 15:15:45.510 Dean:    d
2022-01-23 15:15:43.390 Dean:    I just want to refrechmy mins
2022-01-23 15:15:30.006 Dean:    how easy is it to convert the .kon or .js image placement to HTML? I presume we are using the .js logic to position each item rather than CSS?
2022-01-23 12:26:08.990 Dean:    it makes sense for the future
2022-01-23 12:25:57.150 Dean:    v
2022-01-23 12:25:51.686 Dean:    gie me time on that though
2022-01-23 12:25:41.606 Dean:    and a linux test box too
2022-01-23 12:25:31.005 Dean:    I will set up a Win 10/11 test box
2022-01-23 12:12:15.182 Dean:    but it is genuinely useful
2022-01-23 12:12:03.036 Dean:    very few know about it at the moment
2022-01-23 12:11:17.128 Dean:    and having that on more than one o/s would be very useful
2022-01-23 12:11:04.655 Dean:    I use the desktop hole regularly
2022-01-23 12:10:47.302 Dean:    those are very useful widgets
2022-01-23 12:10:33.297 Dean:    the next good test would be the desktop hole
2022-01-23 12:10:22.990 Dean:    It means you could move on from YWE
2022-01-23 12:08:58.283 Dean:    that's good
2022-01-23 12:05:54.394 Dean:    of NW js' capabilities
2022-01-23 11:42:53.595 Dean:    I think FC js would be a good test
2022-01-23 11:31:09.352 Dean:    just not for me yet
2022-01-23 11:30:25.895 Dean:    and when I migrate from Windows it would be a feasible environment
2022-01-23 11:29:37.609 Dean:    My suggestion would be to say "go for it!"
2022-01-23 11:29:19.910 Dean:    
2022-01-23 11:28:47.668 Dean:    so no good for me there either
2022-01-23 11:28:39.959 Dean:    my eventual platform is ReactOS and it runs only the classic theme
2022-01-23 11:28:22.974 Dean:    
2022-01-23 11:28:18.921 Dean:    NW js developers I mean
2022-01-23 11:28:03.956 Dean:    if the themeing transparency ever went away I imagine they would use another method
2022-01-23 11:27:03.590 Dean:    and I always seem to be working on technology that shortly after my adoption. goes obsolete
2022-01-23 11:26:32.870 Dean:    trouble is with me, once bitten, twice shy
2022-01-23 11:26:08.327 Dean:    those are my only caveats
2022-01-23 11:26:01.298 Dean:    
2022-01-23 11:25:57.306 Dean:    I'd expect that to change sometime in the future
2022-01-23 11:25:27.522 Dean:    there are other ways of obtaining a transparency in Windows and using the themeing functionality feels the wrong method
2022-01-23 11:24:41.863 Dean:    it basically shows MS is no longer interested in themeing so they are letting it die
2022-01-23 11:24:21.565 Dean:    the fonts as an example
2022-01-23 11:24:14.844 Dean:    and I find when switching themes, certain elements no longer switch as they used to
2022-01-23 11:23:53.550 Dean:    that was done a while ago
2022-01-23 11:23:45.125 Dean:    and an essential part of themeing uxtheme has to be patched in order to make certain theme elements function
2022-01-23 11:23:08.386 Dean:    The classic theme that underpins all other themes has already been surpressed
2022-01-23 11:22:44.548 Dean:    it isn't just a fear, it is already happening.
2022-01-23 11:22:22.193 Dean:    
2022-01-23 11:22:15.421 Dean:    and I expect that sort of functionality to be deprecated soon as the os switches to a single interface and themeing will eventually be superceded
2022-01-23 11:21:10.746 Dean:    removing functionality in favour of their overall corporate style
2022-01-23 11:20:47.774 Dean:    my only caveat would be that if you depend upon the transparency provided by themeing then be aware that MS is slowly crippling themeing
2022-01-23 11:15:40.918 Dean:    I wonder how fast the file i/o functions will be
2022-01-23 11:14:40.856 Dean:    Do you think you could convert FCjs to run on NW js?
2022-01-23 11:13:52.313 Dean:    just because of the limitations
2022-01-23 11:13:45.013 Dean:    but I won't be running NW js generally on this system, my main one
2022-01-23 11:13:21.591 Dean:    with Win10/11
2022-01-23 11:13:17.383 Dean:    I will have another system to test them shortly
2022-01-23 11:12:53.438 Dean:    so I think you should go for it
2022-01-23 11:12:43.512 Dean:    and I think it is the way forward for running your programs on Windows and other oses
2022-01-23 11:12:12.794 Dean:    NW js isa good choice for putting transparent web widgets on the desktop on modern Windows
2022-01-23 11:11:07.680 Dean:    Any interesting news with your projects?
2022-01-23 11:11:02.832 Dean:    
2022-01-23 11:06:16.953 Dean:     Windspeed is 2 knots, force 1, direction N
2022-01-23 11:06:16.906 Dean:     Mostly cloudy at 2800 ft.
2022-01-23 11:06:16.875 Dean:     Humidity: 87 % 
2022-01-23 11:06:16.828 Dean:     Temperature: 6.00 C
2022-01-23 11:06:16.797 Dean:     Pressure: 1035 mb
2022-01-23 11:06:16.750 Dean:     EGSH NORWICH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NORWICH, UNITED KINGDOM 
2022-01-23 11:06:16.703 Dean:     Sun Jan 23 2022 10:50:00 GMT+0000 (GMT Standard Time) 
2022-01-23 11:02:10.656 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-01-23 00:27:40.735 Dean:    but I must be realistic
2022-01-23 00:27:32.215 Dean:    which is a great pity
2022-01-23 00:26:55.294 Dean:    or that won't work on the system configuration I use
2022-01-23 00:25:47.018 Dean:    so I can't see me finding time to do something I will not use myself
2022-01-23 00:25:30.069 Dean:    but it won't be useful for me to use
2022-01-23 00:24:58.511 Dean:    if you want to start converting all yours to web widgets to run on NW JS then it makes sense to do so
2022-01-23 00:11:32.864 Dean:    goodnight
2022-01-23 00:10:52.028 Dean:    at least on Windows
2022-01-23 00:10:17.421 Dean:    so it is a no-go for me
2022-01-23 00:10:10.237 Dean:    and I won't be able to use it
2022-01-23 00:09:59.214 Dean:    is a mistake
2022-01-23 00:09:53.189 Dean:    and replying on MS themeing to accomplish transparency when nw js does not use windows themeing in any other way
2022-01-23 00:09:05.365 Dean:    and the themeing is just being reviewed by MS and lots of it removed
2022-01-23 00:08:35.093 Dean:    as it depends upon the product of two corporations and one organisatiom
2022-01-23 00:07:45.205 Dean:    but the transparency is a problem for me
2022-01-22 23:50:34.610 Dean:    I like the idea of NWJS
2022-01-22 23:49:21.962 Dean:    back again
2022-01-22 23:46:48.930 Dean:    as the theme swicth lost 1/3 of the widgets, they went off screen
2022-01-22 23:46:26.518 Dean:    Having to reboot
2022-01-22 23:13:35.553 Dean:    We would be unwise to rely upon that facility being there
2022-01-22 23:13:11.626 Dean:    removing most of it
2022-01-22 23:13:03.430 Dean:    as MS is currently playing about with the whole process of themeing
2022-01-22 23:12:35.963 Dean:    that themeing facility is lilkely to change or be removed at any time
2022-01-22 23:12:11.378 Dean:    so we know that nwjs uses a feature of the Windows desktop themeing to provide transparency rather than making the background transparent in the usual way of things via an o/s API
2022-01-22 23:10:56.786 Dean:    When windows changes themes and you revert tot he saved theme, it loses certain specified fonts
2022-01-22 23:10:20.242 Dean:    that's better
2022-01-22 23:08:43.705 Dean:    repairing now
2022-01-22 23:08:38.097 Dean:    bloody windoes
2022-01-22 23:08:33.721 Dean:    lost all my fonts when switching back
2022-01-22 23:08:19.233 Dean:    run with the classic theme
2022-01-22 23:08:07.793 Dean:    but it messes with everything
2022-01-22 23:07:55.250 Dean:    transparent background
2022-01-22 23:07:45.721 Dean:    and it works
2022-01-22 23:07:39.866 Dean:    I have tried it using a theme other than classic
2022-01-22 23:03:30.930 Dean:    yes I will but it really mucks up with the whole config. bloody windoes
2022-01-22 22:59:09.466 Dean:    from the web
2022-01-22 22:59:03.729 Dean:    "Transparency might not work on classic theme"
2022-01-22 22:55:30.177 Dean:    or the equivalent of that
2022-01-22 22:55:18.081 Dean:    so the NW dropbox widget effectively builds a batch file that runs nwjs in the same folder where the manifest is
2022-01-22 22:51:10.409 Dean:    is the mask failing?
2022-01-22 22:51:01.809 Dean:    why do I see a black background rather than a transparent one?
2022-01-22 22:50:36.881 Dean:    so, the next question
2022-01-22 22:50:06.826 Dean:    understood
2022-01-22 22:49:19.210 Dean:    she is time consuming and it is very hard to concentrate on anything else
2022-01-22 22:48:57.770 Dean:    excuse my not seeing that full message earlier, very tired and very pre-occupied with mum
2022-01-22 22:48:03.281 Dean:    ?
2022-01-22 22:48:01.193 Dean:    why doesn't nw js know the folder it is running in and pick up the manifest from that folder
2022-01-22 21:40:49.802 Dean:    but the background is a solid black
2022-01-22 21:40:41.233 Dean:    and the frame is invisible
2022-01-22 21:40:28.194 Dean:    it runs
2022-01-22 21:35:30.401 Dean:    where is the NW dropbox widget?
2022-01-22 21:33:20.680 Dean:    <><>nwjs.png
2022-01-22 21:31:53.353 Dean:    I see the folder contents listed in a NW js window
2022-01-22 21:31:40.073 Dean:    that is an interesting result
2022-01-22 21:30:33.263 Dean:    hmmm
2022-01-22 21:28:35.202 Dean:    in the oven
2022-01-22 21:28:31.712 Dean:    macaroni cheese here
2022-01-22 21:28:25.778 Dean:    
2022-01-22 20:55:15.673 Dean:    I drag the uboat.html to the nw js app
2022-01-22 20:54:35.649 Dean:    perhaps I am doing something wrong
2022-01-22 20:01:26.301 Dean:    How do you start an NWJS app on Mac?
2022-01-22 19:56:59.157 Dean:    I can try and change the title, width anything, all ignored
2022-01-22 19:36:52.816 Dean:    I don't see it
2022-01-22 19:36:48.585 Dean:    how do you get to the config options in nw?
2022-01-22 19:36:29.616 Dean:    by default
2022-01-22 19:36:23.161 Dean:    it seems to have more configuration options available to NW
2022-01-22 19:36:06.721 Dean:    old version does the same
2022-01-22 19:18:06.960 Dean:    I'll try an older version
2022-01-22 19:17:21.104 Dean:    it would be known
2022-01-22 19:17:10.329 Dean:    nothing obvious
2022-01-22 19:16:59.960 Dean:    I have looked on the forum
2022-01-22 19:16:48.449 Dean:    it doesn't care
2022-01-22 19:10:00.864 Dean:    I think it is not finding the package manifest
2022-01-22 19:09:40.341 Dean:    ignored
2022-01-22 19:09:37.870 Dean:    if I put something illegal in it
2022-01-22 19:09:27.596 Dean:    package renamed has no effect
2022-01-22 19:09:07.335 Dean:    it just runs
2022-01-22 19:09:00.937 Dean:    not here
2022-01-22 18:51:53.369 Dean:    nothing here
2022-01-22 18:51:47.259 Dean:    what does it do?
2022-01-22 18:51:43.680 Dean:    if you remove package.json or do something illegal in it
2022-01-22 18:51:03.920 Dean:    some time in the future
2022-01-22 18:50:56.897 Dean:    except to linux
2022-01-22 18:50:49.472 Dean:    and I'm not moving from 7
2022-01-22 18:50:19.426 Dean:    except XP
2022-01-22 18:50:14.144 Dean:    it seems to be the same distro for all oses
2022-01-22 18:49:59.184 Dean:    nope
2022-01-22 18:49:50.544 Dean:    it seems to ignore the .json file
2022-01-22 18:49:06.848 Dean:    very strange
2022-01-22 18:48:27.424 Dean:    e
2022-01-22 18:48:25.904 Dean:    no change ther
2022-01-22 18:48:18.049 Dean:    no, I am still on win7
2022-01-22 17:17:11.709 Dean:    no change
2022-01-22 17:10:18.376 Dean:    now trying with the normal distro
2022-01-22 17:10:03.897 Dean:    I previously downloaded the SDK
2022-01-22 17:07:06.996 Dean:    nw.js ver 0.60.0
2022-01-22 17:06:47.104 Dean:    it runs despite me changing everything to "arse!
2022-01-22 17:06:03.000 Dean:    it seems to be ignoring the .json file
2022-01-22 17:03:06.529 Dean:    it just ignores the two directives
2022-01-22 16:59:47.496 Dean:    latest version from the website
2022-01-22 16:57:42.152 Dean:    not so far
2022-01-22 16:56:33.272 Dean:    but frame is there
2022-01-22 16:56:27.560 Dean:    all operates as it should
2022-01-22 16:54:07.824 Dean:    yes
2022-01-22 16:52:28.136 Dean:    but frame shown
2022-01-22 16:52:21.480 Dean:    has the correct package contents
2022-01-22 16:52:06.256 Dean:    trying uboat
2022-01-22 16:51:55.402 Dean:    doesn't seem to work here
2022-01-22 16:51:49.576 Dean:    hmmm
2022-01-22 16:49:38.881 Dean:    how do you make them operate frameless?
2022-01-22 16:49:17.729 Dean:    even with json
2022-01-22 16:49:10.736 Dean:    nixie not working here on win
2022-01-22 16:47:11.778 Dean:    good
2022-01-22 16:47:04.736 Dean:    ah yes
2022-01-22 16:27:33.504 Dean:    where are the latest frameless widgets you have been playing with? Are they on DB yet?
2022-01-22 16:27:06.200 Dean:    most seem to operate
2022-01-22 16:21:17.849 Dean:    d
2022-01-22 16:21:16.568 Dean:    understoof

2022-01-22 16:19:59.425 Dean:    not looking into each in detail
2022-01-22 16:19:46.105 Dean:    just going through each in turn
2022-01-22 16:18:18.322 Dean:    only nw.js it did nothing
2022-01-22 16:18:07.215 Dean:    I tried it there
2022-01-22 16:18:01.648 Dean:    yes
2022-01-22 16:15:08.544 Dean:    the nixie web storage widget did not run
2022-01-22 16:14:52.776 Dean:    so far no problems
2022-01-22 16:14:38.560 Dean:    superb video
2022-01-22 16:13:30.849 Dean:    I have been working my way through them
2022-01-22 14:55:08.068 Dean:    you archive of NW widgets is on Dropbox?
2022-01-22 12:31:42.964 Dean:    same here
2022-01-22 11:49:18.750 Dean:    nice to see the sun

2022-01-21 17:47:40.728 Dean:    nw.js downloaded and installed
2022-01-21 11:01:43.334 Dean:    for the moment it is important that the devices are securely mounted
2022-01-21 11:01:23.278 Dean:    you can always drill out any holes and plug them later with dowel
2022-01-21 11:01:04.358 Dean:    you should drill and be damned
2022-01-21 11:00:45.375 Dean:    [quote] Thinking about my new work stands/cabinets - have to decide whether or not to drill holes to bolt power tools down onto worktops. [/quote]

2022-01-20 17:26:06.105 Dean:    righto
2022-01-20 14:35:10.976 Dean:    lots of hoovering to do now though
2022-01-20 14:35:04.528 Dean:    
2022-01-20 14:34:31.889 Dean:    but it now works and I have done no significant harm to the battery
2022-01-20 14:34:14.001 Dean:    the battery is not quite as pretty as it used to be
2022-01-20 14:33:55.712 Dean:    and it operates it too
2022-01-20 14:33:50.569 Dean:    after surgery, the battery has been tested and it now fits the bike
2022-01-20 14:33:27.168 Dean:    that is drying now
2022-01-20 14:33:20.249 Dean:    this left a few small holes in the ABS which I have filled with black milliput
2022-01-20 14:32:52.761 Dean:    using the grinder I managed to cut away at thes econd batteryandtrim the sides, cut a lug space at the rear and give it a cutout at the front
2022-01-20 12:22:30.133 Dean:    I will now in detail
2022-01-20 11:43:51.412 Dean:    I will review
2022-01-20 10:38:50.876 Dean:    is the process, convert to a web widget then convert to a NW.js app?
2022-01-20 10:38:25.389 Dean:    might be useful to others considerig resurrecting an old widget too
2022-01-20 10:38:03.549 Dean:    but a documented example would be very useful as a reference
2022-01-20 10:37:43.461 Dean:    a guide would be nice
2022-01-20 10:37:38.196 Dean:    ?
2022-01-20 10:37:36.516 Dean:    can you dicument one of our shared widgets as a guide to allow me to dabble in a conversion
2022-01-20 10:36:41.517 Dean:    as I get bored I may dip my toe
2022-01-20 10:36:28.548 Dean:    but I will finish FCW and Steamydock first
2022-01-20 10:36:14.748 Dean:    you are right and I will make it my aim to migrate my widgets

2022-01-20 10:18:32.117 Dean:    Hello!
2022-01-19 22:01:47.430 Dean:    bu I feel I ought
2022-01-19 22:01:42.007 Dean:    It will take me a while to get going on mine
2022-01-19 19:55:41.086 Dean:    frameless?
2022-01-19 19:55:33.805 Dean:    Do you think it will be possible to rewrite all our widgets and get them to operate using NW.js?
2022-01-19 19:54:54.952 Dean:    they aren't
2022-01-19 19:54:50.766 Dean:    the should be the same
2022-01-19 19:54:29.238 Dean:    battery 2
2022-01-19 19:54:24.809 Dean:    <><>271646528_509390030487147_8040886905908708080_n.jpg
2022-01-19 19:54:22.150 Dean:    battery 1

2022-01-19 18:39:37.270 Dean:    interesting
2022-01-19 14:25:07.957 Dean:    photos to come
2022-01-19 14:24:54.997 Dean:    it should then fit
2022-01-19 14:24:50.828 Dean:    all along both sides
2022-01-19 14:24:40.909 Dean:    so a a grinder will be required to remove some plastic
2022-01-19 14:24:27.461 Dean:    but not very well...
2022-01-19 14:24:06.445 Dean:    and they are probably copying another's battery type
2022-01-19 14:23:50.621 Dean:    the manufacturers are all in China
2022-01-19 14:23:39.589 Dean:    whent he battery is in situ
2022-01-19 14:23:31.245 Dean:    but the amount of force needed to connect and disconnect is beyond normal human capability
2022-01-19 14:23:07.085 Dean:    meaning the battery form and connections are all good
2022-01-19 14:22:56.021 Dean:    and the slot by which the batteries are secured are tighter by 3-4mm
2022-01-19 14:22:26.261 Dean:    some lugs are wider by 2mm
2022-01-19 14:22:16.241 Dean:    it seems the second companyhas followed the same form factor but had made changes to suit their own manufacturing
2022-01-19 14:21:41.740 Dean:    measuring and checking to see why not
2022-01-19 14:21:32.629 Dean:    I have a second battery of the same type but ti does not fit
2022-01-19 14:21:20.468 Dean:    been working on the bike
2022-01-19 14:20:59.685 Dean:    if they had all been orientated north-south we wouldn't have this problem :)
2022-01-19 14:20:37.613 Dean:    it is inconvenient of them to have built all the roads East to West
2022-01-19 10:25:59.526 Dean:

2022-01-18 23:30:16.203 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2022-01-18 22:17:03.232 Dean:    just testing the quotation functionality in FCW
2022-01-18 22:16:38.476 Dean:    very interesrting
2022-01-18 22:16:04.066 Dean:    [quote] Frameless apps do not have a title bar for the user to click and drag the window. You can use CSS to designate DOM elements as draggable regions. [/quote] 
2022-01-18 21:09:15.237 Dean:    and a lot going on
2022-01-18 21:09:10.600 Dean:    as I have a lot to do
2022-01-18 21:09:06.201 Dean:    give me a while
2022-01-18 21:08:58.816 Dean:    I will need some help from you setting it up
2022-01-18 21:08:48.019 Dean:    I will have a go at NW.js
2022-01-18 21:04:37.172 Dean:    those work benches, all three look the job
2022-01-18 21:04:18.735 Dean:    the indoor workshop looks good
2022-01-18 21:01:55.937 Dean:    I have to admit
2022-01-18 21:01:51.544 Dean:    th attenuator does look good
2022-01-18 13:24:16.221 Dean:    oh well
2022-01-18 13:24:01.973 Dean:    I have seen forums complaining that they could not download even in 2009
2022-01-18 13:23:41.877 Dean:    it seems that even his archive files were corrupt from the very beginning
2022-01-18 13:16:21.626 Dean:    and obviously lost interest
2022-01-18 13:16:12.980 Dean:    he failed to give it a annovative name
2022-01-18 13:15:42.008 Dean:    but I suppose he failed to take it forward
2022-01-18 13:15:26.387 Dean:    I Was actively scanning at that time
2022-01-18 13:15:17.067 Dean:    still an impressie bit of work
2022-01-18 13:14:59.952 Dean:    how amazing that we missed it
2022-01-18 13:14:48.015 Dean:    yes
2022-01-18 13:03:23.795 Dean:    uses the chap's own script engine
2022-01-18 13:02:33.595 Dean:     the .7z downloads are all corrupt
2022-01-18 13:02:00.572 Dean:    GUI
2022-01-18 13:01:56.968 Dean:    and uses Delphi as the scripting language
2022-01-18 13:01:48.932 Dean:    GI designer
2022-01-18 13:01:45.701 Dean:    it has an editor
2022-01-18 13:01:40.740 Dean:    have you seen that one before?
2022-01-18 12:45:57.592 Dean:    https://www.delphipraxis.net/119493-desktop-widget-engine-v0-72-a.html
2022-01-18 12:45:56.344 Dean:    ich denke
2022-01-18 12:45:46.481 Dean:    du bist besser als mich
2022-01-18 12:45:13.886 Dean:    
2022-01-18 12:45:10.267 Dean:    you are better than me 
2022-01-18 12:45:04.385 Dean:    any good at German?
2022-01-18 12:44:57.987 Dean:    
2022-01-18 12:36:34.541 Dean:    and although I like .js for me, it isn't the be all and end all
2022-01-18 12:36:06.607 Dean:    it is not aiming to put widgets n the desktop seamlessly
2022-01-18 12:35:46.238 Dean:    I like .js but the direction of the frameworks is not 'ours' I feel
2022-01-18 12:35:13.672 Dean:    time to check perhaps
2022-01-18 12:35:07.036 Dean:    and certainly not native
2022-01-18 12:34:59.142 Dean:    a few years back it was possible but not easy
2022-01-18 12:34:39.682 Dean:    I think it might be time to see how easy this might be in Delphi with Lazarus
2022-01-18 12:34:17.648 Dean:    it could be Delphi
2022-01-18 12:34:09.393 Dean:    the language at that point is immaterial
2022-01-18 12:33:53.663 Dean:    then a code editor that jumps to the object's events automaticall on dbl click
2022-01-18 12:32:56.690 Dean:    or they can be disabled and controls switched off
2022-01-18 12:32:33.594 Dean:    native support and design for transparent programs, no form controls 
2022-01-18 12:32:06.613 Dean:    that is the starting point
2022-01-18 12:32:00.919 Dean:    just like xwidgets IDE but just done better
2022-01-18 12:31:48.433 Dean:    something similar to the VB6 IDE taht allows drop and place
2022-01-18 12:31:31.986 Dean:    
2022-01-18 12:31:25.038 Dean:    and without that anything else feels like a kludge
2022-01-18 12:31:10.683 Dean:    I need that IDE to build apps in aRAD fashion
2022-01-18 12:30:51.781 Dean:    I think it is native transparency support with the IDE that is my target
2022-01-18 12:30:08.633 Dean:    What I really want is xwidget with Konfabulator underneath
2022-01-18 12:29:36.177 Dean:    I also want a designer and IDE
2022-01-18 12:29:25.875 Dean:    NWJS feels like a series of bodges to me
2022-01-18 12:29:01.094 Dean:    I need to see something like one of my apps running windowless on the desktop to believe it
2022-01-18 12:15:51.025 Dean:    If it requires learning a new language then I'd do it
2022-01-18 12:15:24.727 Dean:    natively on the desktop
2022-01-18 12:15:09.844 Dean:    I want the capability to create windowless apps with transparencies both behind and layered
2022-01-18 12:14:43.197 Dean:    It isn't so much .js for me
2022-01-18 11:25:24.153 Dean:    if we could find that, even if it involved a new language it might be worth pursuing
2022-01-18 11:24:51.243 Dean:    specifically graphical programs that operate without forms and traditional windows
2022-01-18 11:24:22.866 Dean:    we need to find a new environment and runtime that will allow us to create the specialised programs that we create
2022-01-18 11:23:55.653 Dean:    
2022-01-18 11:23:55.243 Dean:    
2022-01-18 09:55:08.790 Dean:    as long as I make progress that will be a learning lesson for me
2022-01-18 09:54:47.589 Dean:    FCW later today I will set about creating that class and dumping the email functionality into that
2022-01-18 09:53:40.846 Dean:    all I need to ensure is the batteries' actual charge and discharge rates are the same
2022-01-18 09:53:02.837 Dean:    I am replicating it basically
2022-01-18 09:52:48.017 Dean:    I have dismnatled my abttery pack so I am aware of its construction
2022-01-18 09:52:31.508 Dean:    
2022-01-18 09:52:31.349 Dean:    
2022-01-18 09:52:26.468 Dean:    visible over parts of the UK last week
2022-01-18 09:51:03.229 Dean:    I see it
2022-01-18 09:31:27.866 Dean:    and connectors/correct gauge wire
2022-01-18 09:31:13.852 Dean:    then some wrapping tape
2022-01-18 09:31:05.046 Dean:    spot welding
2022-01-18 09:30:59.964 Dean:    and a method of welding the batteries together
2022-01-18 09:30:45.766 Dean:    I need a BMS module
2022-01-18 09:30:38.092 Dean:    and I am ammassing the parts
2022-01-18 09:30:26.379 Dean:    my intention is to build a couple of battery packs for my electric bike
2022-01-18 09:29:48.792 Dean:    I have testing device coming that will be able to discharge each battery and let me know the real capacity and discharge rate
2022-01-18 09:29:11.383 Dean:    appearing from various sources
2022-01-18 09:29:03.354 Dean:    over time
2022-01-18 09:28:58.259 Dean:    I now have about 40 batteries
2022-01-18 09:28:45.675 Dean:    the others are fine
2022-01-18 09:28:39.811 Dean:    it was the charging circuitry or a lone battery that failed
2022-01-18 09:28:24.523 Dean:    in almost all cases the batteries have not been at fault
2022-01-18 09:28:02.966 Dean:    and dropping to about 82-85%
2022-01-18 09:27:50.513 Dean:    losing only 0.3v
2022-01-18 09:27:35.027 Dean:    each has recovered amazing ly well
2022-01-18 09:27:23.156 Dean:    and then retest the voltage drop, write that on the battery, recharge and do the same
2022-01-18 09:27:02.323 Dean:    and left for 18 months
2022-01-18 09:26:54.749 Dean:    then I recharged
2022-01-18 09:26:47.607 Dean:    when I extract I test the voltage and write that on the battery body and the date
2022-01-18 09:26:14.128 Dean:    I have been testing each battery over 18 months
2022-01-18 09:25:58.996 Dean:    and I extract the batteries using mechanical means
2022-01-18 09:25:38.140 Dean:    each pack has failed over time
2022-01-18 09:25:21.745 Dean:    he enclosed ones that do not allow access to the underlying batteries
2022-01-18 09:25:05.312 Dean:    I have been removing 18650 batteriee from old laptop batteries

2022-01-17 23:24:08.095 Dean:    BTW that potato peeler is my top recommendation
2022-01-17 23:23:50.151 Dean:    eating other people's food is always more fun thant your own

2022-01-17 23:22:33.984 Dean:    fry those in oild
2022-01-17 23:22:29.952 Dean:    then reduce the potato by peeling the flesh in a long continuous strip
2022-01-17 23:22:04.391 Dean:    peel first
2022-01-17 23:22:00.616 Dean:    and we will make potato strips using the peeler

2022-01-17 23:18:03.260 Dean:    do you have one?
2022-01-17 23:17:56.696 Dean:    I use a potato peeling machine
2022-01-17 23:17:46.232 Dean:    very heavy indeed
2022-01-17 23:17:30.472 Dean:    i fed six of us, we all had seconds and 30% was still left
2022-01-17 23:17:02.478 Dean:    by the way that cottage pie was much bigger than it looks
2022-01-17 23:14:12.661 Dean:    and so tasty on a Winter's evening
2022-01-17 23:14:04.488 Dean:    Such a good mix
2022-01-17 23:13:52.589 Dean:    carrots and brussel sprouts went in with the meat
2022-01-17 23:13:13.952 Dean:    and a pinch of chilli flakes
2022-01-17 23:13:01.095 Dean:    the mince was beef, with one onion chopped, a tin of lentils, tin of tomatoes, garlic, Lea and Perrins Worcester, a table spoon of marmite, three beef oxos, salt and pepper
2022-01-17 23:11:59.488 Dean:    
2022-01-17 23:11:41.040 Dean:    cheddar on top and inside
2022-01-17 23:11:34.975 Dean:    grate cheese too
2022-01-17 23:11:26.768 Dean:    with a teaspoon of English mustard
2022-01-17 23:11:12.919 Dean:    mixed with mascarpone cheese, single cream and a large chunk of butter
2022-01-17 23:10:42.760 Dean:    made the mash using potatoes from a friend's farm
2022-01-17 23:10:27.929 Dean:    it was good
2022-01-17 20:02:58.177 Dean:    <><>cottagePie.png
2022-01-17 19:57:19.212 Dean:    2 degrees
2022-01-17 19:57:13.732 Dean:    cold here too
2022-01-17 19:37:16.452 Dean:    s
2022-01-17 19:37:15.284 Dean:    I think you need to rewrite the desktop hole uding a new language
2022-01-17 19:36:51.803 Dean:    so, why the pronouncement on giving up widgets?
2022-01-17 16:39:08.776 Dean:    as he is learning smallBasic at school now
2022-01-17 16:38:58.432 Dean:    but we are just going over them afresh
2022-01-17 16:38:49.363 Dean:    things he learnt before
2022-01-17 16:38:41.308 Dean:    integers, booleans, strings &c
2022-01-17 16:38:22.411 Dean:    and how naughty a GOTO is
2022-01-17 16:38:11.835 Dean:    intitialising vars, arrays, labels and GOTOs
2022-01-17 16:37:44.428 Dean:    just taught my boy variable declarations, functions and sub routines
2022-01-17 16:31:28.107 Dean:    just testing
2022-01-17 16:31:18.630 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2022-01-17 14:54:39.427 Dean:    TTFN
2022-01-17 14:54:37.379 Dean:    except for xwidgets/rainwidgets, both of which are stillborn
2022-01-17 14:54:16.483 Dean:    I have come across nothing like it since
2022-01-17 14:54:06.291 Dean:    in .js
2022-01-17 14:53:58.962 Dean:    still there is nothing as good as YWE for putting good looking, functional programs on your dekstop
2022-01-17 14:53:13.061 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:53:04.387 Dean:    then multiplatform with adoption of different graphic options but that is a long way off
2022-01-17 14:52:38.601 Dean:    the code will be Windows specific in the first phase
2022-01-17 14:52:10.674 Dean:    I am in touch with one developer and the other is making amazing progress
2022-01-17 14:51:49.995 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:51:48.307 Dean:    so VB6 is the way forward for me at the moment
2022-01-17 14:51:38.602 Dean:    and I DO have TwinBasic/RADBasic as the next generation of  VB6+
2022-01-17 14:51:02.996 Dean:    but not for a long while yet I feel
2022-01-17 14:50:52.915 Dean:    When FCW is done in VB6 I will look at converting it upwards
2022-01-17 14:50:07.660 Dean:    otherwise it is Windows all the way I am afraid!
2022-01-17 14:49:55.985 Dean:    then we can still communicate
2022-01-17 14:49:44.662 Dean:    if you fancy writing FCW in a multi platform tool such as VB.NET
2022-01-17 14:49:00.845 Dean:    but I WILL do it.
2022-01-17 14:48:54.739 Dean:    I may be slow
2022-01-17 14:48:47.667 Dean:    I will complete FCW and Steamydock
2022-01-17 14:48:36.755 Dean:    and they will run there
2022-01-17 14:48:30.261 Dean:    but you still have windows
2022-01-17 14:48:16.739 Dean:    as it is holding your o/s back
2022-01-17 14:48:07.179 Dean:    you may be at that point where you need to move on with YWE on Mac
2022-01-17 14:47:48.081 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:47:39.620 Dean:    just not straightforward when you try to do things that are 'clever'
2022-01-17 14:47:17.738 Dean:    VB6 is very enjoyable
2022-01-17 14:47:11.000 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:47:08.228 Dean:    might as well leanr C#
2022-01-17 14:46:59.810 Dean:    implemented in C# style
2022-01-17 14:46:48.862 Dean:    I have tried VB.NET and it is a hodgepodge
2022-01-17 14:46:35.338 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:46:33.283 Dean:    they just wrap them up and present them differently
2022-01-17 14:46:21.075 Dean:    all the later frameworks come down to using APIs in the end
2022-01-17 14:45:58.883 Dean:    and familiarity with Win APIs is exposure to the real world, closer to the metal as it were
2022-01-17 14:45:34.987 Dean:    in addition due to VB6's limitations, it forces me to use the o/s APIs
2022-01-17 14:45:15.186 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:45:00.181 Dean:    so more lessons learnt
2022-01-17 14:44:54.331 Dean:     and it is forcing me to write my first class module
2022-01-17 14:44:44.443 Dean:    so I am learning a practical lesson
2022-01-17 14:44:35.051 Dean:    the VB6 limitastion I just described is also a limitation of the successor VB.NET
2022-01-17 14:44:09.379 Dean:    and would be lost without their functionality on my desktop
2022-01-17 14:43:56.987 Dean:    I use the gauges all the time
2022-01-17 14:43:41.019 Dean:    I am using the media player now
2022-01-17 14:43:31.555 Dean:    I would not do without them
2022-01-17 14:43:22.291 Dean:    and they do function SO very well
2022-01-17 14:43:14.427 Dean:    as they just work on windows
2022-01-17 14:43:04.811 Dean:    I am no longer creating any widgets but I will continue to run them
2022-01-17 14:42:35.939 Dean:    and I have not completed my projects so I will stick with it
2022-01-17 14:42:18.558 Dean:    Well VB6 is all I know except for .js
2022-01-17 13:56:11.542 Dean:    to keep warm
2022-01-17 13:56:08.112 Dean:    wearing fingerless gloves
2022-01-17 13:56:02.072 Dean:    sorry about typos
2022-01-17 13:54:43.079 Dean:    
2022-01-17 13:54:32.466 Dean:    we'll see how that goes
2022-01-17 13:54:19.444 Dean:    so, I need to fihure that out
2022-01-17 13:54:08.811 Dean:    and reference it from there
2022-01-17 13:53:56.378 Dean:    so now I have to take my working code, encapsulate it into a class
2022-01-17 13:53:36.927 Dean:    to share the email code I need to put it into a module but it no longer works with events
2022-01-17 13:53:08.263 Dean:    it has to be in a FORM or similar
2022-01-17 13:52:59.720 Dean:    as code at the shared level cannot handle events
2022-01-17 13:52:37.067 Dean:    and these variables have to be declared at the form level
2022-01-17 13:52:17.594 Dean:    but the soultion uses a privater variable WITHEVENTS rhat allows it to reaspond to external events
2022-01-17 13:51:45.531 Dean:    the program works well in the prefs
2022-01-17 13:51:34.710 Dean:    having a little problem with getting FCW to email
2022-01-17 13:51:16.526 Dean:    
2022-01-17 10:56:22.310 Dean:    the new version of VB6 TwinBasic will have that compileIf
2022-01-17 10:55:50.604 Dean:    but it would be something I could have used in that situation
2022-01-17 10:55:09.181 Dean:    but not any code that should not be compiled
2022-01-17 10:54:54.389 Dean:    I have code that when compiled should only be run if the code is in the IDE and vice versa
2022-01-17 10:54:11.062 Dean:    I like the idea
2022-01-17 10:54:05.732 Dean:    I have not encountered them before
2022-01-17 10:20:22.245 Dean:    new to me
2022-01-17 10:20:19.265 Dean:    have you ever come across a compileIF statement?
2022-01-17 10:19:50.101 Dean:    
2022-01-17 10:19:46.881 Dean:    as only a deep sleep can provide
2022-01-17 10:19:37.270 Dean:    feeling refreshed
2022-01-17 09:31:14.740 Dean:    good deep sleep
2022-01-17 09:30:58.125 Dean:     Windspeed is 6 knots, force 2, direction WSW

2022-01-17 09:30:45.876 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-01-16 22:10:01.464 Dean:    off to bed soon
2022-01-16 22:01:52.663 Dean:    but they were well liked
2022-01-16 22:01:45.279 Dean:    not my sort of thing
2022-01-16 22:01:34.424 Dean:    I remember them well
2022-01-16 20:30:07.237 Dean:    <o><o>1F614 PENSIVE FACE
2022-01-16 20:26:57.459 Dean:    also very cold
2022-01-16 20:26:45.660 Dean:    cold
2022-01-16 20:26:39.519 Dean:    went cycling yesterday briefly
2022-01-16 20:26:30.968 Dean:    
2022-01-16 20:18:54.698 Dean:    I need some cottage pie
2022-01-16 20:18:38.267 Dean:    just one bit of work to do and it will be done
2022-01-16 20:18:24.684 Dean:    My own personal emails all seem to be working again
2022-01-16 20:18:10.523 Dean:    
2022-01-16 20:17:56.933 Dean:    putting the structure in place
2022-01-16 20:17:40.278 Dean:    and then writing the value to the settings.ini, reading it back &c
2022-01-16 20:17:19.773 Dean:    writing and checking a lastEmailDate
2022-01-16 20:17:05.984 Dean:    I am working on the email functionality
2022-01-16 20:16:24.479 Dean:    LOVED that
2022-01-16 20:16:18.888 Dean:    Elsa once asked a Dutch lady on a bus if an Uitvaart Centrum (they were passing) was a sort of travel agency.
2022-01-16 20:16:13.848 Dean:    
2022-01-16 20:00:08.559 Dean:    hard day here with hangiover and mum combined
2022-01-16 15:46:34.254 Dean:    my head is cloudy
2022-01-16 15:46:27.357 Dean:    slowly looking at my code
2022-01-16 10:24:26.333 Dean:    foolish me
2022-01-16 10:24:19.692 Dean:    Bit too sloshed last night
2022-01-15 13:53:14.112 Dean:    seems to be working well
2022-01-15 13:53:00.248 Dean:    easy to do in the IDE but requires msgbox pop ups when compiled
2022-01-15 13:52:39.912 Dean:    just testing my timer logic
2022-01-15 13:52:24.784 Dean:    verge in French supposedly means penis
2022-01-15 13:52:12.288 Dean:    "soft verge"
2022-01-15 13:51:57.672 Dean:    wir farhen gegen England
2022-01-15 13:51:40.408 Dean:    exit

2022-01-15 12:06:54.084 Dean:    
2022-01-15 12:06:50.862 Dean:     Windspeed is 3 knots, force 1, direction S
2022-01-15 12:06:50.819 Dean:     Scattered clouds at 1000 ft.
2022-01-15 12:06:50.775 Dean:     Humidity: 81 %

2022-01-15 12:06:46.983 Dean:    
2022-01-15 11:59:56.160 Dean:    when you see my code it will explain itself better than I just did
2022-01-15 11:58:59.406 Dean:    
2022-01-15 11:58:58.964 Dean:    
2022-01-15 11:58:17.503 Dean:    and I hope/am sure that timers will emerge that have support for intervals greater than 65536 millisecs
2022-01-15 11:57:30.449 Dean:    when TwinBasic/RADBasic emerges
2022-01-15 11:57:15.786 Dean:    all this will be done away with
2022-01-15 11:56:59.680 Dean:    and that calls the logic itself
2022-01-15 11:56:50.623 Dean:    that is initiated when the codeTimer does its stuff
2022-01-15 11:56:29.808 Dean:    that is a callback routine
2022-01-15 11:56:23.352 Dean:    and finally, there is another routine
2022-01-15 11:42:34.512 Dean:    if I want a timer that operates with values > 65536 msecs and one that operates in the IDE
2022-01-15 11:42:00.436 Dean:    but that is how it must be
2022-01-15 11:41:53.088 Dean:    a bit overly complicated
2022-01-15 11:41:44.367 Dean:    
2022-01-15 11:41:42.103 Dean:    and as the logic is the same for each, these are just stubs that call another routine containing the logic
2022-01-15 11:41:15.312 Dean:    the next two routines are the equivalent of each other and contain the code that is called directly by the timers
2022-01-15 11:39:36.392 Dean:    the first routine is called at startup and calls either the VB6 timer or the code timer
2022-01-15 11:39:27.136 Dean:    we have two equivalent timers, one for VB6 and one in code
2022-01-15 11:38:28.632 Dean:    each timer has five routines assocoaiated with it
2022-01-15 11:13:45.488 Dean:    tidying up my timer code to ensure it is a little more readable and logical

2022-01-14 16:25:22.893 Dean:    yes the writing of the encrypted pwd is adding the blank lines
2022-01-14 16:25:03.306 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Microsoft Windows XP  Version:0.0.1843
2022-01-14 16:08:13.673 Dean:    so the pwd acts incorrectly when empty
2022-01-14 16:07:55.957 Dean:    you have the old version
2022-01-14 14:40:27.573 Dean:    I'll allow renaming of the config slots later
2022-01-14 14:39:59.036 Dean:    I have handled an empty password field
2022-01-14 14:18:36.204 Dean:    and I do need to do something about the empty password field
2022-01-14 14:18:21.996 Dean:    You will be able to name the configuration options
2022-01-14 14:08:07.700 Dean:    eg. smtpAuthenticate0=1
2022-01-14 14:07:47.037 Dean:    and add a 0 ot the name of the config options
2022-01-14 14:07:36.977 Dean:    edit the settings.ini
2022-01-14 14:07:30.363 Dean:    or 
2022-01-14 14:07:27.627 Dean:    you may have to re-enter your settings
2022-01-14 14:07:08.932 Dean:    but OK for testing

2022-01-14 00:17:57.683 Dean:    FCW modified to allow saving of up to five SMTP configs
2022-01-13 21:00:08.873 Dean:    we also have an emergency hoist with a brake that allows anyone to escape from the third floor
2022-01-13 20:59:10.193 Dean:    it allows someone to climb out and down most of the way
2022-01-13 20:58:54.297 Dean:    we have a rolled up ladder which we attach to a window ledge and throw out the window
2022-01-13 20:58:25.742 Dean:    do you have an escape ladder for your apartment?

2022-01-13 20:57:23.969 Dean:    in he USA there are slates that can act as 1.5v solar panels
2022-01-13 20:56:08.427 Dean:    any news on the roof?

2022-01-13 10:51:27.792 Dean:    hop to code the multiple SMTP configs today
2022-01-13 10:51:06.614 Dean:    you could get them to install a solar panel and an aerial or two whilst they are up there
2022-01-13 10:50:47.716 Dean:    do you know what they are up to?

2022-01-11 22:09:14.758 Dean:    is there any surviving original code written in IMP?
2022-01-11 22:08:47.951 Dean:    so it means the language survives and can be used again
2022-01-11 22:08:13.710 Dean:    and it is then compiled using gcc
2022-01-11 22:07:55.929 Dean:    so, it has aparser that converts to C?
2022-01-11 17:55:49.103 Dean:    what does it  run on now?
2022-01-11 17:55:39.111 Dean:    Who wrote the latest version?
2022-01-11 17:08:51.567 Dean:    What is that?
2022-01-11 13:30:56.610 Dean:    I Was also using it to communicate with someone
2022-01-11 13:30:46.037 Dean:    and so nothing to worry about
2022-01-11 13:30:32.676 Dean:    now I log in and see I was half way through an update

2022-01-11 13:29:50.157 Dean:    unfinished transfer
2022-01-11 13:29:44.365 Dean:    Well sort of
2022-01-11 13:29:39.389 Dean:    No
2022-01-11 11:26:52.906 Dean:    which I intend to use
2022-01-11 11:26:47.126 Dean:    so I was stuck out of github
2022-01-11 11:26:35.543 Dean:    I had changed ti but not noted the change nor was it saved in the browser
2022-01-11 11:26:20.649 Dean:    I have managed to reset my github password
2022-01-11 11:25:56.082 Dean:    email now appears to be working again

2022-01-10 12:52:02.879 Dean:    github for example
2022-01-10 12:51:55.927 Dean:    but the email is tturning out to be essential as I had registered a few places using it
2022-01-10 12:51:31.319 Dean:    I have enough time to consider it if not to do it
2022-01-10 12:51:14.887 Dean:    thinking about it
2022-01-10 12:50:57.175 Dean:    I think I might experiment
2022-01-10 12:05:43.763 Dean:    quicker than expected
2022-01-10 12:04:55.156 Dean:    a bit more email repair and I will be running on all email cylinders
2022-01-10 12:03:37.777 Dean:    next time I will not trust my domain registrar
2022-01-10 11:38:49.008 Dean:    give it 24hrs
2022-01-10 11:37:25.471 Dean:    the email may start to operate now - incoming
2022-01-10 11:36:49.991 Dean:    latest version
2022-01-10 11:36:38.143 Dean:    uncustomised
2022-01-10 11:36:32.199 Dean:    new installation
2022-01-10 11:36:28.081 Dean:    it does not even appear using firefox
2022-01-10 11:11:50.838 Dean:    which I do not have
2022-01-10 11:11:41.696 Dean:    or use Chrome!
2022-01-10 11:11:35.207 Dean:    so I have two browser open in order to do anything
2022-01-10 11:11:21.543 Dean:    and TSOhosts live chat does not operate in Firefox
2022-01-10 11:11:09.047 Dean:    As an aside, TSOhost Cpanel only operates in Firefox and not my default browser Palemoon
2022-01-10 11:10:28.951 Dean:    but I'll let them do that
2022-01-10 11:10:17.903 Dean:    easy enough
2022-01-10 11:10:13.847 Dean:    so I have to manually change the nameservers to the default
2022-01-10 11:09:53.679 Dean:    but it seems that they have a button that you select that does nothing during the transfer
2022-01-10 11:09:30.311 Dean:    I wanted to make the transfer simple...
2022-01-10 11:09:09.783 Dean:    despite me requesting that they use the default nameservers 
2022-01-10 11:08:51.151 Dean:    it seems that the nameservers are still those that were transferred over
2022-01-10 10:59:14.951 Dean:    with live chat at TSOhosts
2022-01-10 10:59:03.374 Dean:    just working on the MX record propagation
2022-01-10 10:58:24.806 Dean:    
2022-01-10 10:58:21.832 Dean:    so, a rewrite of that section is required or adding a delay
2022-01-10 10:58:00.063 Dean:    but it appears that it is not doing what it should do
2022-01-10 10:57:43.567 Dean:    I added some checks to see if the stream was already open and being written to
2022-01-10 10:57:20.118 Dean:    
2022-01-10 09:59:08.711 Dean:    but FCW does improve...
2022-01-10 09:58:54.854 Dean:    the list never shortens
2022-01-10 09:58:48.167 Dean:    I am gathering the runtime errors in my list
2022-01-10 09:58:21.943 Dean:    is when Dropbox has had its knickers in a twist and is perpetually synching the output file due to a large queu and slow network times in Dropbox#
2022-01-10 09:57:45.966 Dean:    the only other time it has occurred
2022-01-10 09:57:39.031 Dean:    
2022-01-10 09:57:36.148 Dean:    at the o/s level
2022-01-10 09:57:18.126 Dean:    I thinkthe next write occurs before the o/s has had time to write and close the previous stream
2022-01-10 09:56:46.352 Dean:    and that should sort it
2022-01-10 09:56:33.655 Dean:    I think I my have to inject a delay or convert all the pasted lines to one long stream
2022-01-10 09:56:07.654 Dean:    using the same routine as for just one line but calling it multiple times
2022-01-10 09:55:51.318 Dean:    at the moment I am going through the process of converting to a stream and writing it for each line
2022-01-10 09:55:26.399 Dean:    but it should not need it
2022-01-10 09:55:19.191 Dean:    so a delay might sort it

2022-01-09 23:12:36.529 Dean:    I have made changes but I need to dig deeper
2022-01-09 23:12:26.094 Dean:    writing a stream of data and sometimes the stream won't be written
2022-01-09 23:11:33.217 Dean:    hard to pin down
2022-01-09 23:11:28.317 Dean:    the file write method might need a delay in between writes
2022-01-09 23:11:05.657 Dean:    that's happened to me too
2022-01-09 23:10:59.457 Dean:    yes
2022-01-09 22:40:37.665 Dean:    but my guess is that the propagation has not been triggered
2022-01-09 22:40:18.153 Dean:    and it is correct
2022-01-09 22:40:14.897 Dean:    I can view its setting at this end on the dashboard
2022-01-09 22:39:25.713 Dean:    and that needs to be replaced
2022-01-09 22:39:18.696 Dean:    pointing elsewhere
2022-01-09 22:39:11.945 Dean:    yes, that is the old MX record

2022-01-09 19:28:59.304 Dean:    and less so my amperage as they are all mostly the same
2022-01-09 19:28:43.481 Dean:    the batteries are sorted by voltage and type
2022-01-09 19:28:29.144 Dean:    it has three drawers
2022-01-09 19:28:23.040 Dean:    added compartments the correct size for various batteries

2022-01-09 19:21:42.296 Dean:    checking the amperage of each type
2022-01-09 19:21:27.190 Dean:    thinking of building a bike battery
2022-01-09 19:21:16.128 Dean:    but still quite good after 18 months
2022-01-09 19:21:03.688 Dean:    just three are showing a problem, not holding a charge quite as well
2022-01-09 19:20:42.000 Dean:    hardly any change to 90% of them
2022-01-09 19:20:32.040 Dean:    if they have and by how much
2022-01-09 19:20:24.520 Dean:    18 mnths later doing the same to see how they have discharged
2022-01-09 19:20:12.448 Dean:    wrote th initial values on the sides, charged them, updated the values
2022-01-09 19:19:54.032 Dean:    salvaged 30+ 18 months ago
2022-01-09 19:19:35.715 Dean:    testing 18650 batteries here salvaged from old laptops
2022-01-09 19:19:21.887 Dean:    
2022-01-09 19:19:15.638 Dean:    or the changes have failed to propagate
2022-01-09 19:19:06.353 Dean:    so there is a misconfiguration with the MX record
2022-01-09 19:18:51.808 Dean:    but incoming are not
2022-01-09 19:18:46.128 Dean:    as I said, all outgoing emails are sending
2022-01-09 19:18:33.329 Dean:    so it hould all kick into operation
2022-01-09 19:18:22.072 Dean:    The domain and the nameservers are all registered with the same host
2022-01-09 19:17:49.436 Dean:    not so bothered about the site
2022-01-09 19:17:40.779 Dean:    working on email records first
2022-01-09 18:41:33.374 Dean:    I am using supposedly the Incoming Server: 	sxb1plzcpnl453525.prod.sxb1.secureserver.net

2022-01-09 11:28:57.420 Dean:    but summat is wrong
2022-01-09 11:28:53.320 Dean:    I am using the server's name servers and it should all have worked
2022-01-09 11:28:01.185 Dean:    so that I can send an email but anyone who sends me one, it disappears into the ether
2022-01-09 11:27:30.339 Dean:    it seems that with my email problem I have an account that has been resurrected, I re-rgistered the domain but the MX record has not propagated around the net

2022-01-07 23:01:51.420 Dean:    I was going to take the bike out for an evening cycle
2022-01-07 18:33:42.061 Dean:    Did you hear about Norton implementing crypto mining on user's PC by default?
2022-01-07 18:33:11.553 Dean:    
2022-01-07 18:32:17.433 Dean:    and I might take it out tonight

2022-01-07 18:31:15.598 Dean:    
2022-01-07 18:31:09.557 Dean:    has it improved the clattering/shaking?
2022-01-07 10:31:25.142 Dean:    fixing!
2022-01-07 10:31:21.086 Dean:    no coding today

2022-01-05 17:36:57.781 Dean:    
2022-01-05 17:36:57.221 Dean:    This email work has caused me to tidy up my emails altogether
2022-01-05 17:36:30.008 Dean:    recovering old emails from my old email package on another system
2022-01-05 14:14:58.370 Dean:    almost made that change
2022-01-05 14:14:54.009 Dean:    
2022-01-05 12:13:44.629 Dean:    sometimes the email settings are incorrectly set by idiot admins on the server side
2022-01-05 12:13:12.312 Dean:    and you never know what they might be trying to do
2022-01-05 12:13:02.379 Dean:    I have encountered some interesting combinations
2022-01-05 12:12:43.461 Dean:    it will be down to the user to select what has been enabled for his server
2022-01-05 12:12:04.602 Dean:    I am not going to limit the port selections
2022-01-05 12:11:53.116 Dean:    
2022-01-05 12:11:44.051 Dean:    just testing it
2022-01-05 12:11:38.061 Dean:    I have added a SMTP config dropdown and selection
2022-01-05 11:02:53.654 Dean:    '    smtpuserPassword1

2022-01-05 11:02:38.749 Dean:    '
2022-01-05 11:01:48.328 Dean:    ' add a combobox dropdown to the smtp server section that allows selection of smtp configs
2022-01-05 11:01:48.298 Dean:    
2022-01-05 11:01:46.558 Dean:    Med. Priority task
2022-01-05 11:01:25.087 Dean:    
2022-01-05 11:01:21.947 Dean:    once evry three/four years?
2022-01-05 11:01:10.946 Dean:    how often does that need doing?
2022-01-05 11:01:01.814 Dean:    expensive job owning a narrow boat
2022-01-05 10:36:00.142 Dean:    recent errors too
2022-01-05 10:35:53.135 Dean:    with a timestamp then I can email 
2022-01-05 10:35:37.245 Dean:    I may log errors to an output log 
2022-01-05 10:35:25.310 Dean:    thinking about that
2022-01-05 10:34:53.558 Dean:    also, for any non-fatal error messages
2022-01-05 10:34:41.159 Dean:    but my next job will be to sort the emails via timestamp and compare that to the chosen interval and then email that text to the recipient
2022-01-05 10:33:57.790 Dean:    I won't be coding for a bit as I have a lot to catch up with
2022-01-05 10:33:32.559 Dean:    glad to hear it is stable for you

2022-01-05 10:32:37.591 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-01-04 23:14:38.814 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-01-04 23:14:34.348 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-01-04 20:33:51.568 Dean:    it is a basic email client
2022-01-04 20:33:32.137 Dean:    that has no wizard just a simple add account tool
2022-01-04 20:33:21.078 Dean:    so I use Sylpheed another Windows email client
2022-01-04 20:32:53.249 Dean:    or set up test accounts to poll Smtp servers that are malconfigured in some way
2022-01-04 20:32:22.864 Dean:    so you cannot add details for the future
2022-01-04 20:32:07.993 Dean:    Sometimes the wizard won't let you leave until the account details are polling correctly
2022-01-04 20:31:17.448 Dean:    thunderbird is not bad but the new account wizard can be a pain
2022-01-04 18:01:12.211 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86cQJ0MMses
2022-01-04 18:00:02.904 Dean:    there is a video that is wporth watching onthe subject
2022-01-04 17:59:30.249 Dean:    e
2022-01-04 17:59:28.224 Dean:    or rather slightly beforr that or it would not work
2022-01-04 17:59:11.560 Dean:    then it hands it over to port 587
2022-01-04 17:58:54.080 Dean:    when it has done its job of negotiating the STARTTLS
2022-01-04 17:58:34.560 Dean:    regardless of what you put in the port field for STARTTLS
2022-01-04 17:58:18.665 Dean:    the mitm proxy we have is actually open on port 10025
2022-01-04 17:57:47.649 Dean:    the user can choose
2022-01-04 17:57:38.024 Dean:    I don't restrict a particular port to a type of handshaking/encryption
2022-01-04 17:56:51.272 Dean:    you don't want it falling back to another less powerful mode of encryption or plain text
2022-01-04 17:55:58.448 Dean:    yes, that's basically it.
2022-01-04 15:35:34.352 Dean:    I might add a load and save email configuartions later
2022-01-04 13:19:49.071 Dean:    please replace that into the help folder

2022-01-03 18:39:32.192 Dean:    working on FCW as always
2022-01-03 16:50:40.981 Dean:    which I will update fo email
2022-01-03 16:50:34.241 Dean:    sending you the updated html help shortly
2022-01-03 16:50:13.736 Dean:    I can't control either
2022-01-03 16:50:03.275 Dean:    so it is either google blocking or Win10/11
2022-01-03 16:49:47.894 Dean:    my gmail is working
2022-01-03 16:49:32.832 Dean:    it is too much of a pain
2022-01-03 16:49:23.151 Dean:    but I am done with gmail for now
2022-01-03 16:49:10.839 Dean:    all looks good
2022-01-03 16:48:50.815 Dean:    you can remove that junk from the file now
2022-01-03 16:45:06.890 Dean:    that will help to narrow it down
2022-01-03 16:44:54.116 Dean:    it'll be Win10/11
2022-01-03 16:44:44.825 Dean:    or
2022-01-03 16:44:42.255 Dean:    then it will work for you
2022-01-03 16:44:36.545 Dean:    get a hotmail account for testing
2022-01-03 16:44:25.692 Dean:    so, dump it for the moment
2022-01-03 16:44:14.071 Dean:    but remember gmail is probably blocking you
2022-01-03 16:44:01.640 Dean:    send me your settings.ini
2022-01-03 16:43:42.727 Dean:    so previous attempts could be read
2022-01-03 16:43:29.944 Dean:    but I added the clear button instead to allow the user to clear it when he wanted to
2022-01-03 16:43:06.102 Dean:    I was considering clearing it before each poll
2022-01-03 16:42:51.228 Dean:    and you will see the latest poll
2022-01-03 16:42:44.307 Dean:    you need to scroll down
2022-01-03 16:42:37.866 Dean:    it is at the top
2022-01-03 16:42:33.056 Dean:    if you see the scrollbox
2022-01-03 16:42:11.402 Dean:    so it does not confuse between connections
2022-01-03 16:42:01.291 Dean:    Don't forget to clear the window
2022-01-03 16:30:42.917 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1827
2022-01-03 15:55:10.099 Dean:    often it is immediate and then sometimes it can be ten mins or so
2022-01-03 15:54:52.927 Dean:    sometimes gmail can take a long time to process the emails when successfully sent
2022-01-03 15:54:38.544 Dean:    re: FCW and email
2022-01-03 15:54:33.583 Dean:

2022-01-03 15:52:44.524 Dean:    so here is the new version, just one line removed
2022-01-03 15:52:32.421 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2022-01-03 15:52:11.728 Dean:    it just does not produce the 'extra' junk
2022-01-03 15:51:55.867 Dean:    but essentially it is the same code
2022-01-03 15:51:47.825 Dean:    I have now removed that
2022-01-03 15:51:38.474 Dean:    the junk in the file was a result of my test code
2022-01-03 13:29:14.192 Dean:    that we can never handle
2022-01-03 13:29:05.900 Dean:    it has another level of app security
2022-01-03 13:28:52.728 Dean:    I have also tested yahoo email and that cannot be implemented
2022-01-03 13:28:15.893 Dean:    
2022-01-03 13:28:12.702 Dean:    hideen behind an abnormal GUI
2022-01-03 13:27:56.347 Dean:    as it seems to have no hidden security
2022-01-03 13:27:38.142 Dean:    I will use hotmail to test from now on
2022-01-03 13:27:27.240 Dean:    so I want no more to do with gmail
2022-01-03 13:27:18.676 Dean:    and it said you had to authorise on your huawaei tablet for me to continue
2022-01-03 13:26:55.824 Dean:    it said NO
2022-01-03 13:26:50.704 Dean:    I no longer have access to your gmail
2022-01-03 13:26:41.973 Dean:    and you have to dig into gmail to fox that
2022-01-03 13:26:30.511 Dean:    as gmail simply says NO
2022-01-03 13:26:23.281 Dean:    we could have managed to get the config correct for gmail may times and it would not have mattered
2022-01-03 13:25:55.029 Dean:    so it will be a better test
2022-01-03 13:25:47.149 Dean:    no security there
2022-01-03 13:25:41.908 Dean:    is to create a hotmail account
2022-01-03 13:25:35.417 Dean:    next thing you could test
2022-01-03 13:25:28.277 Dean:    so I am going to leave it
2022-01-03 13:25:20.514 Dean:    it works here!
2022-01-03 13:16:38.531 Dean:    but I have learnt a lot
2022-01-03 13:16:30.008 Dean:    I've spent ages on it
2022-01-03 13:16:11.125 Dean:    
2022-01-03 13:16:09.654 Dean:    and I was right
2022-01-03 13:16:04.334 Dean:    I knew that email was going to be awful
2022-01-03 13:15:55.543 Dean:    
2022-01-03 13:15:54.923 Dean:    but if it does not work then I will need the alternative
2022-01-03 13:15:40.750 Dean:    and because of stability/known bugs
2022-01-03 13:15:28.608 Dean:    I prefer to use the APIs where possible for consistency
2022-01-03 13:15:09.405 Dean:    I still have my alternative code just in case
2022-01-03 13:14:57.223 Dean:    I may well still have a problem with using the APIs
2022-01-03 13:14:38.772 Dean:    and I will look into the rubbish later
2022-01-03 13:14:28.879 Dean:    just try as it is
2022-01-03 13:14:23.729 Dean:    don't edit the rubbish
2022-01-03 13:14:03.798 Dean:    and match that
2022-01-03 13:14:00.608 Dean:    see last PNG I sent you
2022-01-03 13:13:37.054 Dean:    smtpServer=smtp.gmail.com
2022-01-03 13:12:48.208 Dean:    smtp.gmail.com
2022-01-03 13:12:22.392 Dean:    smtp server is incorrect
2022-01-03 10:42:53.470 Dean:    and you need to go in and for each, accept that the activity was yours...
2022-01-03 10:42:28.775 Dean:    as it had done
2022-01-03 10:42:26.175 Dean:    and automatically block it
2022-01-03 10:42:11.655 Dean:    it may log suspicious activity from a machine/app combination
2022-01-03 10:41:29.353 Dean:    this means logging into google dashboard and becoming familiar with it
2022-01-03 10:41:11.975 Dean:    in oorder to operate in a 'norma;' fashion
2022-01-03 10:38:24.489 Dean:    Well, these new security protocols mean that you have to maintain your settings on the dashboard and respond to events
2022-01-03 01:41:01.103 Dean:    goodnight!
2022-01-03 00:30:24.838 Dean:    none encountered with hotmail
2022-01-03 00:30:10.662 Dean:    we hit three levels just when checking the account
2022-01-03 00:29:44.416 Dean:    as it is too riddled with security checks
2022-01-03 00:29:29.279 Dean:    I would do that rather then use the google mail
2022-01-03 00:29:12.015 Dean:    and easy to test
2022-01-03 00:29:07.582 Dean:    easy to enter the details
2022-01-03 00:29:02.078 Dean:    easy to create
2022-01-03 00:28:56.591 Dean:    we know that process works
2022-01-03 00:28:49.358 Dean:    you can create a hotmail account
2022-01-03 00:28:34.847 Dean:    is ti now only google that is being a pain
2022-01-03 00:28:26.462 Dean:    those two message prove the concept works
2022-01-03 00:28:09.487 Dean:    as your details are being used in multiple locations
2022-01-03 00:27:51.398 Dean:    and I suspect we are making more now
2022-01-03 00:27:43.623 Dean:    and cleared them
2022-01-03 00:27:40.182 Dean:    I found two of those on your google dashboard
2022-01-03 00:27:30.166 Dean:    and raising suspiocious activity alarms
2022-01-03 00:27:15.210 Dean:    What might be happening is that gmail is recognising emails being sent from two different places
2022-01-03 00:25:56.939 Dean:    <><>gmailSettings.jpg
2022-01-03 00:25:10.415 Dean:    wait a sec
2022-01-03 00:01:05.675 Dean:    but I think I have done what was needed
2022-01-03 00:00:56.325 Dean:    it won't even let me look at your details any further
2022-01-03 00:00:33.948 Dean:    email from your account is now working
2022-01-03 00:00:23.573 Dean:    any how, regardless of that
2022-01-02 23:58:49.534 Dean:    then send me the code
2022-01-02 23:58:30.774 Dean:    what a bloody to-do!
2022-01-02 23:58:10.785 Dean:    Choose an account to get your code
2022-01-02 23:58:10.733 Dean:    Under 'Signing in to Google' tap Security code
2022-01-02 23:58:10.678 Dean:    Select the Security tab (you may need to scroll to the right)
2022-01-02 23:58:10.567 Dean:    Tap Manage your Google Account
2022-01-02 23:58:10.521 Dean:    Choose your account, if it not already selected
2022-01-02 23:58:10.481 Dean:    Tap Google
2022-01-02 23:58:10.430 Dean:    Open the Settings app
2022-01-02 23:57:56.430 Dean:    it wants you to sign in on your Huawei HUWEI MediaPad T3
2022-01-02 23:57:26.567 Dean:    it is riddled with security
2022-01-02 23:57:15.847 Dean:    bloody hell
2022-01-02 23:53:22.783 Dean:    I'll do some digging
2022-01-02 23:53:17.966 Dean:    I'm in
2022-01-02 23:52:23.702 Dean:    send it to me ASAP please
2022-01-02 23:45:59.470 Dean:    to the phone ending in 35
2022-01-02 23:45:53.006 Dean:    it has sent you a verification code
2022-01-02 22:54:12.399 Dean:    please do so and I should be able to check
2022-01-02 22:53:29.334 Dean:    it should ask you to validate my device (windows via firefox)
2022-01-02 22:53:08.750 Dean:
2022-01-02 22:53:02.466 Dean:    I am trying to log into your google account via webmail so I can check the settings
2022-01-02 22:37:59.895 Dean:    that will hopefully be more reliable
2022-01-02 22:37:42.407 Dean:    I have a new and more powerful encryption method too
2022-01-02 22:37:27.186 Dean:    and then test of Win10 and all may be revealed
2022-01-02 22:37:17.503 Dean:    so, I am going to stop for a while
2022-01-02 22:37:06.183 Dean:    Well, I am email here, there and everywhere

2022-01-02 21:56:38.766 Dean:

2022-01-02 21:56:23.937 Dean:    thei time converting the data to base64 beforehand
2022-01-02 21:56:12.002 Dean:    I am using the old API again

2022-01-02 20:22:45.070 Dean:    I MAY have cracked it
2022-01-02 19:08:22.814 Dean:    no wonder it was hard to find
2022-01-02 19:08:13.622 Dean:    one tiny character!
2022-01-02 19:08:01.757 Dean:    there is a bug in the encryption routine
2022-01-02 19:07:19.533 Dean:    then decrypt on the fly
2022-01-02 19:07:08.557 Dean:    yes
2022-01-02 19:05:03.429 Dean:    that is strange!

2022-01-02 18:57:20.070 Dean:    save it
2022-01-02 18:57:13.765 Dean:    tyr my pwd ^$D2!Y93J_1Y!l)
2022-01-02 18:56:38.549 Dean:    FCW'd you the latest
2022-01-02 18:56:32.461 Dean:    sorry
2022-01-02 18:56:29.798 Dean:    I emailed you the latest
2022-01-02 18:56:24.245 Dean:    did you take the latest FCWin?
2022-01-02 18:55:56.973 Dean:    which I suspect
2022-01-02 18:55:52.718 Dean:    I will try it on Win10 and see if the problems are specific to it
2022-01-02 18:55:35.302 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:55:33.198 Dean:    I have proven it works
2022-01-02 18:55:25.701 Dean:    I have the app working for email from Win7 using four accounts
2022-01-02 18:55:07.669 Dean:    so,
2022-01-02 18:55:04.277 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:54:59.206 Dean:    too much security, too much to code
2022-01-02 18:54:47.629 Dean:    in fact I think email will die if it all becomes too complex
2022-01-02 18:54:31.118 Dean:    email clients are dying out
2022-01-02 18:54:12.702 Dean:    email is becoming too complex!
2022-01-02 18:54:01.621 Dean:    Thunderbird and sylpheed
2022-01-02 18:53:53.989 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:53:49.398 Dean:    tried two clients both failed
2022-01-02 18:53:35.422 Dean:    So that was pointless
2022-01-02 18:53:23.789 Dean:    a total failure
2022-01-02 18:53:20.069 Dean:    I have just spent hours creating a yahoo email account and trying to confugure my client (TB) to work with it
2022-01-02 18:52:54.685 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:52:50.766 Dean:    Well, I give up for the moment
2022-01-02 16:36:15.157 Dean:    do you have any other email account?
2022-01-02 16:12:47.559 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1819
2022-01-02 16:08:10.253 Dean:    pls try mine again

2022-01-02 16:06:34.421 Dean:    but it does not work for your details
2022-01-02 16:06:25.725 Dean:    and it works for me
2022-01-02 16:06:21.885 Dean:    it passes the correct password to gmail SMTP server
2022-01-02 16:06:06.101 Dean:    I have ensured that ALL is now working as it should be
2022-01-02 16:05:55.956 Dean:
2022-01-02 13:37:06.564 Dean:    fixing
2022-01-02 13:37:03.580 Dean:    jsut not enough...
2022-01-02 13:36:59.108 Dean:    reliable
2022-01-02 13:36:56.268 Dean:    but more rleiable
2022-01-02 13:36:48.828 Dean:    same as the Win APIs
2022-01-02 13:36:42.036 Dean:    but not others...
2022-01-02 13:36:35.724 Dean:    some password combinations were working
2022-01-02 13:36:22.124 Dean:    not difficult
2022-01-02 13:36:19.028 Dean:    so, my workaround routines need rejigging
2022-01-02 13:36:04.252 Dean:    the FSO method does handle unicode supposedly but there is another bug as the writing does not
2022-01-02 13:35:27.044 Dean:    I have to rewrite my two routines to use the unicode method of writing that I am using for the main data files
2022-01-02 13:34:54.640 Dean:
2022-01-02 13:08:05.594 Dean:    still a bug to be ironed out
2022-01-02 13:07:59.268 Dean:    don't do it yet
2022-01-02 13:07:54.517 Dean:    nope

2022-01-02 13:05:24.540 Dean:    try mine at your end
2022-01-02 13:05:08.064 Dean:    something seems wrong
2022-01-02 13:04:07.453 Dean:    password: w5r5ldk11rt5n
2022-01-02 13:03:43.476 Dean:    username g6auc0@gmail.com- what is that 0, shouldn't be six?
2022-01-02 13:02:57.485 Dean:    I cannot make your gmail SMTP details work
2022-01-02 13:02:44.232 Dean:
2022-01-02 12:45:58.675 Dean:    but it matters not
2022-01-02 12:45:53.417 Dean:    so slower
2022-01-02 12:45:49.148 Dean:    have to read/write whole file/write updated date to temporary file and then rename/delete old
2022-01-02 12:45:15.061 Dean:    they do not read/write using keys so a little slower
2022-01-02 12:45:00.861 Dean:    so, two new routines created as a workaround
2022-01-02 12:44:42.339 Dean:    but that only occurred when I changed the variable name
2022-01-02 12:44:03.419 Dean:    then it happened to the writing too
2022-01-02 12:43:55.740 Dean:    for a while it was only the reading of the data
2022-01-02 12:43:43.930 Dean:    happened randomly
2022-01-02 12:43:30.995 Dean:    it was the API havig a wobbly when writing my encrypted data
2022-01-02 12:43:10.431 Dean:
2022-01-02 12:43:01.818 Dean:    I will test with your gmail SMTP details shortly

2022-01-02 11:29:34.822 Dean:    my boy was out and I had to wait up for him
2022-01-02 11:29:04.704 Dean:    late one last night
2022-01-02 11:28:08.296 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-01-02 11:28:00.338 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-01-02 01:12:51.251 Dean:    SO many bugs in Windows and none of them MINE!
2022-01-02 01:12:37.956 Dean:
2022-01-02 01:01:59.783 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-01-02 00:48:10.831 Dean:    I will send you the new version whan I have tested it
2022-01-02 00:19:06.553 Dean:    and it is
2022-01-02 00:19:04.758 Dean:    just tested it is inow writing correctly
2022-01-02 00:18:50.825 Dean:    but it will work
2022-01-02 00:18:43.740 Dean:    it is now slower to read and write the settings.ini file
2022-01-02 00:18:30.385 Dean:    just as I did when reading
2022-01-02 00:18:21.662 Dean:    so I have bypassed the API
2022-01-02 00:18:11.410 Dean:    but the API that writes the string to the INI file was placing four strange double chars after the encrypted password
2022-01-02 00:17:22.130 Dean:    but the password itself was encrypted and written identically
2022-01-02 00:17:04.093 Dean:    I changed the key from pop3Password to SMTPPassword
2022-01-02 00:16:11.961 Dean:    and with those passwords
2022-01-02 00:16:00.881 Dean:    it was working
2022-01-02 00:15:56.575 Dean:    yes it is the write API
2022-01-02 00:15:51.301 Dean:
2022-01-01 23:06:09.516 Dean:    but I will need to determine why, all of a sudden
2022-01-01 23:05:55.363 Dean:    I think the write API is doing the same
2022-01-01 23:05:43.395 Dean:    due to a failure of the read API to recognise some chars
2022-01-01 23:05:26.450 Dean:    the API that reads from an INI file has been replaced by a manual tool that does the same
2022-01-01 23:05:02.966 Dean:    same again
2022-01-01 23:05:00.267 Dean:    I think I have found the bug
2022-01-01 23:04:50.843 Dean:
2022-01-01 22:43:00.157 Dean:    I need to find out why
2022-01-01 22:42:50.391 Dean:    I think the password is being decrypted incorrectly at the time it tests
2022-01-01 22:42:28.419 Dean:    I will research
2022-01-01 22:42:23.099 Dean:    stop for the moment
2022-01-01 22:40:25.864 Dean:    but it worked well, we have probably flooded it with incorrect credentials
2022-01-01 22:40:04.253 Dean:    gmail has stopped working here too
2022-01-01 21:54:36.868 Dean:    and I'll try and decrypt it here
2022-01-01 21:54:15.803 Dean:    would you send me your encrypted pass code from the settings.ini that resulted in redaxota's
2022-01-01 21:53:32.192 Dean:    it is strange, that incorrect reading of the password
2022-01-01 21:52:28.134 Dean:    back again
2022-01-01 17:27:45.102 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2022-01-01 17:26:15.162 Dean:    should be just redaxota
2022-01-01 17:25:51.694 Dean:    there were extra characters
2022-01-01 17:25:44.798 Dean:    on your pipex pwd
2022-01-01 17:25:37.791 Dean:
2022-01-01 17:24:39.196 Dean:    unsure what some of the chars might be
2022-01-01 17:24:24.748 Dean:    can you send it here as text pls
2022-01-01 17:24:16.712 Dean:    your password for gmail
2022-01-01 17:22:23.877 Dean:    pipex was the most tricky
2022-01-01 16:04:09.195 Dean:    y
2022-01-01 16:04:07.026 Dean:    and ou have to say yes to network access if it does...
2022-01-01 16:03:52.482 Dean:    The firewall message will pop up
2022-01-01 16:02:53.600 Dean:    as those a re live accounts
2022-01-01 16:02:47.547 Dean:    please destroy them afterwards!
2022-01-01 16:02:25.592 Dean:    so you can try those if you want
2022-01-01 16:02:19.037 Dean:
2022-01-01 16:02:05.867 Dean:    including passwords
2022-01-01 16:01:59.142 Dean:    Those are the details of the accounts I have tested so far
2022-01-01 16:01:32.824 Dean:    enabled allow insecure apps in google's dashboard
