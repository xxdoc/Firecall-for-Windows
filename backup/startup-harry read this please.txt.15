2021-10-23 23:06:48.161 X:    it would help
2021-10-23 23:06:45.118 X:    so we add one after the user's prefix

2021-10-23 17:23:34.650 Dean:    both recordings are good
2021-10-23 17:22:49.770 Dean:    can you please send me an AWAKE and see itf the response is suitable?
2021-10-23 16:56:23.630 Dean:    now resolved
2021-10-23 16:13:29.580 Dean:    getting closer to having something to install

2021-10-23 13:44:47.590 Dean:    another version does the same
2021-10-23 13:44:38.660 Dean:    It was not the quickSort that was causing the problem

2021-10-23 12:21:36.360 Dean:    with a bit of tidying it will do
2021-10-23 12:21:07.000 Dean:    but the functionality is similar
2021-10-23 12:20:59.450 Dean:    so a little more cumbersome
2021-10-23 12:20:47.090 Dean:    and compare for an exact match
2021-10-23 12:20:39.600 Dean:    I can do a for each loop against that
2021-10-23 12:20:30.420 Dean:    so I am now creating a collection of items and populating with suffixes
2021-10-23 12:20:05.610 Dean:    the suffix .c was matching against .cpp
2021-10-23 12:19:46.870 Dean:    there is no arrayList faciltity in VB6
2021-10-23 12:19:26.520 Dean:    and not an arrayList or a list of elements as you would find in .js
2021-10-23 12:19:06.280 Dean:    but the list is a simple string
2021-10-23 12:18:55.970 Dean:    to search for any occurrence within the list
2021-10-23 12:18:40.180 Dean:    it uses the instr function
2021-10-23 12:18:31.800 Dean:    .cpp for example
2021-10-23 12:18:23.980 Dean:    it works well of the file suffix is three chars
2021-10-23 12:18:10.100 Dean:    and I need to find the current file suffix in that list
2021-10-23 12:17:43.090 Dean:    I have a list of file suffixes
2021-10-23 12:17:29.780 Dean:     I have a small bug that I am fixing
2021-10-23 12:17:20.550 Dean:    
2021-10-23 11:40:49.330 Dean:    I will look at that and compare
2021-10-23 11:19:40.730 Dean:    the output I mean
2021-10-23 11:19:31.240 Dean:    and see what is happening when it reaches a duplicate in the array
2021-10-23 11:19:13.040 Dean:    I will step through it a few times
2021-10-23 11:18:55.190 Dean:    but when it reached a certain size of array its logic seems to have failed
2021-10-23 11:18:22.550 Dean:    it worked well initially

2021-10-23 11:10:57.480 Dean:    for some reason it is duplicating lines on the output
2021-10-23 11:10:35.850 Dean:    array then it quicksorts
2021-10-23 11:10:35.850 Dean:    when combining the two chatboxes it simply reads from the two internal memory structures writing to a new combined 
2021-10-23 11:09:39.950 Dean:    I need a new quicksort algorithm
2021-10-23 10:40:45.100 Dean:    and it is the Mac o/s that is suffering so it makes sense to start there
2021-10-23 10:39:36.590 Dean:    its a step...
2021-10-23 10:39:17.090 Dean:    to move away from the prefs 
2021-10-23 10:39:04.450 Dean:    it makes sense if we are ever going to migrate these widgets
2021-10-23 10:38:47.500 Dean:    but it is not an endemic problem here
2021-10-23 10:38:30.820 Dean:    We had one such instance on Win if I remember correctly
2021-10-23 10:38:11.100 Dean:    and if you cannot rely on the value...
2021-10-23 10:38:00.860 Dean:    we had a few problems with the MAc aggressively cacheing
2021-10-23 10:37:45.550 Dean:    storing within the program as local vars rather than using the prefs value seems sensible
2021-10-23 10:36:30.990 Dean:    so it is done but are you using it?

2021-10-23 10:10:23.320 Dean:    it would be nice to have as much assisance as possible
2021-10-23 10:10:10.260 Dean:    given that the prefs screen can take as long to create as the main program
2021-10-23 10:09:36.350 Dean:    I could then potentially create a VB6 prefs automatically for every widget
2021-10-23 10:09:05.430 Dean:    but I'd like to be able to create a YWE type prefs  in VB6 based upon the KON
2021-10-23 10:08:21.010 Dean:    need to finish current projects
2021-10-23 10:08:14.230 Dean:    I am thinking about creating a VB6 prefs tool based upon an XML reader... not yet though
2021-10-23 10:07:31.250 Dean:    n
2021-10-23 10:07:29.970 Dean:    perhaps we can could automate the creation of a external prefs
2021-10-23 10:06:48.510 Dean:    this way you can have the option to write the prefs for all widgets
2021-10-23 10:06:24.640 Dean:    perhaps it is time to write them to an external file and read back in startup
2021-10-23 10:06:01.530 Dean:    and not your code
2021-10-23 10:05:50.440 Dean:    I think you should accept that that is the prefs that seems "borked" (new word for me)

2021-10-22 14:23:43.380 Dean:    then I will do the email (or attempt it and give up)

2021-10-22 14:23:23.090 Dean:    so that is my next issue to address
2021-10-22 14:23:07.110 Dean:    a new feature recently introduced since the utf8 changes methinks
2021-10-22 14:22:42.110 Dean:    and I am unsure why
2021-10-22 14:22:37.730 Dean:    where it seems to be duplicating lines of text
2021-10-22 14:22:24.270 Dean:    I am just about to fix a bug in the single chat window
2021-10-22 14:22:13.010 Dean:    
2021-10-22 14:22:01.570 Dean:    it is almost there
2021-10-22 14:21:55.480 Dean:    and I just want to get this tool finished!
2021-10-22 14:21:47.090 Dean:    diving into two complicated routines and pulling them together always introduces new bugs
2021-10-22 14:21:10.540 Dean:    and I don't want to implement a third just for a filename
2021-10-22 14:20:51.580 Dean:    and time is precious
2021-10-22 14:20:44.420 Dean:    but they work...
2021-10-22 14:20:39.400 Dean:    I have it in two different routines and I have to pull them together
2021-10-22 14:20:23.640 Dean:    and calculating the offset is not easy in Windows
2021-10-22 14:20:03.600 Dean:    As I won't get round to it for a while
2021-10-22 14:19:52.500 Dean:    Well, it might be sensible to do so
2021-10-22 13:12:02.540 Dean:    Can we find the word HMRC and replace it with the word BASTARDS?
2021-10-22 13:08:57.520 Dean:    later perhaps
2021-10-22 13:08:52.770 Dean:    might be sensible to prevent that
2021-10-22 13:08:32.480 Dean:    do you have any checks on input that prevent such tags being manually types in?
2021-10-22 13:08:11.220 Dean:    I have added the same tag checks to the output file to prwvent me from typing the tags manually

2021-10-22 10:26:26.020 Dean:    and give it to you to try
2021-10-22 10:26:16.780 Dean:    then I will build the installer
2021-10-22 10:26:01.130 Dean:    some text files to create
2021-10-22 10:25:51.220 Dean:    some admin for packaging it up
2021-10-22 10:25:40.730 Dean:    then some testing
2021-10-22 10:25:29.840 Dean:    and one major bit of functionality to add (email)
2021-10-22 10:25:08.070 Dean:    one minor change
2021-10-22 10:24:53.610 Dean:    one high priority bug to fix
2021-10-22 10:22:11.180 Dean:    step by step
2021-10-22 10:22:03.650 Dean:    and will do the same on the output later
2021-10-22 10:21:50.340 Dean:    just made that change on the input data
2021-10-22 10:21:33.460 Dean:    
2021-10-22 10:21:28.300 Dean:    that check was not there previously
2021-10-22 10:21:21.160 Dean:    the tag must be the first thing in the data that the program encounters or it is invalid
2021-10-22 10:20:54.280 Dean:    and someone could type in the same tags anywhere and that would lead to confusion
2021-10-22 10:20:28.780 Dean:    before I was searching for the tags within the whole string at any position
2021-10-22 10:20:04.480 Dean:    prefix, colon and four space gap
2021-10-22 10:20:04.480 Dean:    I have just changed my code to read the tags and only recognise them when they are at position 1, just after the

2021-10-22 09:38:54.210 Dean:    I need to pull duplicated code together first
2021-10-22 09:38:24.460 Dean:    as it woild be nice to be able to create a unix timestamp whenever I like
2021-10-22 09:37:51.380 Dean:    and I'll add it to the list under lower priority
2021-10-22 09:37:36.550 Dean:    so, it'll do for the moment
2021-10-22 09:37:29.670 Dean:    at this stage
2021-10-22 09:37:24.090 Dean:    I am trying to finish this utility and don't need to add more complexity
2021-10-22 09:37:07.450 Dean:    which is unecessary for a unique filename
2021-10-22 09:36:51.720 Dean:    then calculating the deviation
2021-10-22 09:36:51.720 Dean:    I am just building the timestamp manually and to get the time offset requires creating a unix timestamp function and 
2021-10-22 09:36:02.550 Dean:    The timestamp from FCW will stay BST for the moment

2021-10-21 16:37:03.280 Dean:    the three days respite care really makes the difference

2021-10-21 09:56:01.660 Dean:    and move those to an archive file

2021-10-21 09:55:50.620 Dean:    I thought what I would do is to have a task that ran on occasion to remove and archive any lines with a timestamp older

2021-10-20 21:19:22.580 Dean:    tomorrow I will 'change the label names on the prefs to change them to control arrays to make room for more controls 
2021-10-20 21:18:55.270 Dean:    and I have decided not to add them to the prefs as it is simply too much work
2021-10-20 21:18:35.770 Dean:    I have added all the balloon tooltips to the main GUI
2021-10-20 18:50:27.020 Dean:    That is exactly what I do
2021-10-20 17:29:50.900 Dean:    How are the family doing?

2021-10-20 12:28:10.760 Dean:    the ballon tips are very slow to add... tedious
2021-10-20 12:27:37.760 Dean:    it looks very familiar!
2021-10-20 12:15:04.450 Dean:    VB6!
2021-10-20 12:14:58.200 Dean:    it does not work for the emoji drop down as the combobox control does not have an mouse events associated with it
2021-10-20 12:14:25.340 Dean:    then another eight for the emoji control panel
2021-10-20 12:13:57.430 Dean:    9 more balloon tips to go for the main GUI

2021-10-20 11:54:59.600 Dean:    yeuch
2021-10-20 11:52:00.110 Dean:    I saw that
2021-10-20 11:51:53.780 Dean:    I have not seen any code referring to doing that using jscript nor vbscript, my usual source
2021-10-20 11:51:27.210 Dean:    otherwise it will be the use of mciSendString and makeing an activeX connection to winMM.dll
2021-10-20 11:50:51.560 Dean:    I have seen that mentioned

2021-10-20 11:50:24.660 Dean:    the soundrecorde in later versions was meant to be able to be scripted
2021-10-20 11:50:09.470 Dean:    I suspected as much
2021-10-20 11:48:05.340 Dean:    Agreed
2021-10-20 11:47:01.300 Dean:    Morning!
2021-10-20 10:08:27.480 Dean:    and not quite so elegant
2021-10-20 10:08:18.220 Dean:    but not ideal
2021-10-20 10:08:00.670 Dean:    possible
2021-10-20 10:08:00.670 Dean:    I have done the code already in VB6 for FCW so extracting and creating as small prog that yours could call would be 
2021-10-20 10:07:28.980 Dean:    
2021-10-20 10:07:26.410 Dean:    that it could call
2021-10-20 10:07:17.890 Dean:    run in the background to do the same tasks
2021-10-20 10:07:17.890 Dean:    If you find you cannot get mciSendString to operate from YWE then we have the possibility of creating stub Vb6.exe to 
2021-10-20 10:06:24.270 Dean:    
2021-10-20 10:06:19.800 Dean:    off to fix things for a while
2021-10-20 10:06:07.010 Dean:    Thirteen more to go
2021-10-20 10:05:47.580 Dean:    25 done so far
2021-10-20 10:05:20.360 Dean:    and some code to populate the ballon extracted from the HTML help
2021-10-20 10:05:02.260 Dean:    each balloon tip requires a capture of the mouseMove
2021-10-20 10:04:44.160 Dean:    I will enable them throught the prefs but for a new installation it will be on by default
2021-10-20 10:04:19.660 Dean:    added balloon tooltips to 50% of the FCW main utility
2021-10-20 10:03:57.780 Dean:

2021-10-20 09:26:22.500 Dean:    from the command line
2021-10-20 09:26:18.290 Dean:    although I am now unsure it can be made to record

2021-10-19 12:53:12.580 Dean:    much more so than using the in built sound recorder within Windows
2021-10-19 12:52:51.980 Dean:    it is very convenient being able to record inside the app

2021-10-19 12:51:12.790 Dean:    I will listen to each shortly
2021-10-19 12:51:06.730 Dean:    I see that
2021-10-19 12:51:01.590 Dean:    not the way I normally work
2021-10-19 12:50:53.420 Dean:    so, quite a lot simultaneously
2021-10-19 12:50:31.930 Dean:    I am also adding an option to disable Dropbox checks to allow it to work with onedrive or google drive
2021-10-19 12:47:51.480 Dean:    it is rather nice
2021-10-19 12:47:45.270 Dean:    can you see my image with the ballon tooltips?
2021-10-19 12:47:31.530 Dean:    
2021-10-19 12:47:23.020 Dean:    and test
2021-10-19 12:47:20.870 Dean:    I need to enable it
2021-10-19 12:47:17.040 Dean:    it was done but the logic is being skipped
2021-10-19 12:47:01.650 Dean:    I am also modifying my input code to recognise < r > and deal with recordings
2021-10-19 12:46:27.130 Dean:    in this way I can make room for more controls
2021-10-19 12:46:14.990 Dean:    and only count as one control on a form
2021-10-19 12:46:02.840 Dean:    a control array can have a large number of members, possibly 255
2021-10-19 12:45:44.450 Dean:    the VB6 limit of 255 controls per form is only for individual controls
2021-10-19 12:45:25.760 Dean:    so I can identify each when they become part of the amorphous group that is a control array
2021-10-19 12:44:52.830 Dean:    I am copying each label name to a property .tag
2021-10-19 12:44:31.820 Dean:    this means adding each panels labels to an array of similar controls with the same name...
2021-10-19 12:43:53.710 Dean:    and I am also busy converting all my label titles from single controls to control arrays

2021-10-19 11:24:42.610 Dean:    I'll change the code here
2021-10-19 11:24:30.430 Dean:    go ahead and make the spec change
2021-10-19 10:57:49.520 Dean:    or by all means change the spec if you think it would be meaningful to have the random chars meaning something
2021-10-19 10:57:16.980 Dean:    assume it is just a randomly generated set of chars
2021-10-19 10:56:59.070 Dean:    the suffix and the prefix are all that matter
2021-10-19 10:56:44.310 Dean:    I could have used a randomly set of generated digits
2021-10-19 10:56:30.130 Dean:    honestly, I am not using the timestamp in the filename as anything meaningful
2021-10-19 10:56:05.700 Dean:    well, that was taken directly from the running code
2021-10-19 09:45:50.000 Dean:

2021-10-19 09:45:44.100 Dean:    
2021-10-19 09:45:24.460 Dean:    I can take anything
2021-10-19 09:45:06.570 Dean:    as long as I have the suffix, and the duration at the beginning
2021-10-19 09:44:14.010 Dean:    or change it
2021-10-19 09:44:08.790 Dean:    feel free to update the spec. for it though
2021-10-19 09:41:57.150 Dean:    
2021-10-19 09:41:56.230 Dean:    as they take a lot of space
2021-10-19 09:41:49.250 Dean:    we should consider the WAV files to be very temporary and delete-able
2021-10-19 09:41:19.030 Dean:    being the first two chars
2021-10-19 09:41:10.600 Dean:    I do not use the unique filename in any way to ascertain any information other than the duration
2021-10-19 09:40:42.630 Dean:    I chose time as it is an easy enough source to make a unique filename
2021-10-19 09:40:13.850 Dean:    and the suffix of course
2021-10-19 09:40:08.230 Dean:    so it follows no standard other than length and the first two digits that indicate duration
2021-10-19 09:39:37.960 Dean:    the filename for the recordings has no relevance other than being semi-unique
2021-10-19 09:39:12.940 Dean:    
2021-10-19 09:39:10.930 Dean:    puter is back, mum was easy

2021-10-19 09:20:18.740 Dean:    mum...
2021-10-19 09:20:13.540 Dean:    back in 20 or so mins
2021-10-19 09:20:03.950 Dean:    I need to reboot
2021-10-19 09:19:32.500 Dean:    it was more about the method than the filename
2021-10-19 09:19:03.340 Dean:    the secs at the beginning are the duration
2021-10-19 09:18:45.710 Dean:    I just chose a semi random unique timestamp
2021-10-19 09:18:09.390 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2021-10-18 18:08:16.150 Dean:    bloody annoying limitation of VB6
2021-10-18 18:08:05.200 Dean:    that describes its function
2021-10-18 18:07:56.420 Dean:    so each loses its uniquely styled name
2021-10-18 18:07:40.200 Dean:    I have to gather all the labels and create one control array from all the labels
2021-10-18 18:07:03.340 Dean:    again
2021-10-18 18:07:00.140 Dean:    I've hit the control limit of 255 controls on a form on the prefs form

2021-10-18 16:49:02.930 Dean:    they will be launched externally
2021-10-18 16:48:55.250 Dean:    but not quite as recorded files played by FCW itself
2021-10-18 16:48:35.250 Dean:    we can handle them
2021-10-18 16:48:30.150 Dean:    Yes
2021-10-18 16:45:02.590 Dean:    
2021-10-18 16:44:56.410 Dean:    it is rapidly becoming a house-style
2021-10-18 16:44:22.180 Dean:    
2021-10-18 16:43:34.300 Dean:    upon which FCW's look and feel was based
2021-10-18 16:43:21.160 Dean:    That is my launcher program for FireStrike
2021-10-18 16:43:07.460 Dean:    <><>firestrikeLauncher.png
2021-10-18 16:43:03.120 Dean:    on a different subject
2021-10-18 16:42:52.180 Dean:    
2021-10-18 16:41:36.390 Dean:    it will play them externally
2021-10-18 16:41:22.860 Dean:    and I can change VB6 to handle m4a files differently than recorded WAVs
2021-10-18 16:41:00.540 Dean:    you can send m4a files if you cannot get the whole process to work at your satisfaction
2021-10-18 16:40:27.210 Dean:    so,
2021-10-18 16:40:18.550 Dean:    but I will not be able to play it 'within' VB6
2021-10-18 16:40:00.800 Dean:    windows media player
2021-10-18 16:39:56.020 Dean:    I can play it locally here using  the default app
2021-10-18 16:39:42.070 Dean:    That worked
2021-10-18 16:39:07.130 Dean:    then I can see if FCW can play the WAV file internally as it were without the need for a default app to open
2021-10-18 16:38:32.750 Dean:    if poss with the unique filename preceded by the duration <65
2021-10-18 16:37:41.960 Dean:    if you can also send the WAV file with the < r > tags 
2021-10-18 16:36:59.610 Dean:    just as a trial
2021-10-18 16:36:27.240 Dean:    can you send me an m4a too?
2021-10-18 16:36:16.040 Dean:    but I am using the default app to play both
2021-10-18 16:36:00.430 Dean:    both sound fine
2021-10-18 15:20:49.680 Dean:    regardless I am getting very close to the point where I'd like you to test FCW
2021-10-18 15:20:25.730 Dean:    
2021-10-18 15:20:21.070 Dean:    wind out of my sails...
2021-10-18 15:20:10.570 Dean:    I was pleased with my recording idea...
2021-10-18 15:18:25.770 Dean:    at this end on VB6
2021-10-18 15:18:19.120 Dean:    and I have used a tool that should be able to handle mp3
2021-10-18 15:18:04.520 Dean:    I was hoping that at least it would be able to create mp3
2021-10-18 15:17:35.820 Dean:    not a lot of point if you will be mainly using Mac
2021-10-18 15:17:20.710 Dean:    but
2021-10-18 15:17:18.520 Dean:    jsut the background task to do the recording isn't there yet
2021-10-18 15:16:54.500 Dean:    so you can implement the mechanism and test it
2021-10-18 15:16:37.550 Dean:    at least you should be able to do similar with the Windows version
2021-10-18 15:15:56.450 Dean:    bu@@er
2021-10-18 14:34:54.360 Dean:    not particularly elegant
2021-10-18 14:34:39.240 Dean:    I have multiline tooltips working with VB6

2021-10-18 14:34:12.630 Dean:    if I can make balloon tooltips work as expected then it would be most useful addition
2021-10-18 14:26:07.910 Dean:    you cannot be sure which is interfering with which
2021-10-18 14:25:54.010 Dean:    Due to the use of so many APIs to do this or that
2021-10-18 14:14:55.620 Dean:    3rd party code
2021-10-18 14:14:47.400 Dean:    Just tried adding ballon tooltips to FCW without success
2021-10-18 14:14:31.910 Dean:    
2021-10-18 12:03:18.990 Dean:    industry standards
2021-10-18 12:03:18.990 Dean:    A lot of Apple's tools seem to use non-standard formats and then put obstacles in your way when you are trying to use 
2021-10-18 12:02:29.120 Dean:    What a pity it cannot export when scripting
2021-10-18 11:45:29.910 Dean:    that is ubuntu but might help

2021-10-18 11:39:35.030 Dean:    but does the scripting limit you to basic operations?
2021-10-18 11:39:19.090 Dean:    I know QT can export
2021-10-18 11:38:57.350 Dean:    half term - confusing

2021-10-18 11:38:21.520 Dean:    it seems more 'period'
2021-10-18 11:38:08.130 Dean:    but for some reason I like the hiss...
2021-10-18 11:37:56.040 Dean:    better than mine from FCW
2021-10-18 11:37:47.340 Dean:    that WAV was reasonable quality too
2021-10-18 11:37:27.680 Dean:    can you script an export from QT?
2021-10-18 11:37:11.370 Dean:    if it has < r > then my buttons will play it
2021-10-18 11:36:36.880 Dean:    I can hear it!
2021-10-18 11:36:03.770 Dean:    but it is still easier to create a new one!
2021-10-18 11:35:45.850 Dean:    deleting a temporary file
2021-10-18 11:35:35.300 Dean:    that was a comment out of one line
2021-10-18 11:35:24.740 Dean:    so if you ever need a resend it is possible
2021-10-18 11:35:14.540 Dean:    I have amended it to create an interim temporary copy
2021-10-18 11:25:58.050 Dean:    as they are created on the fly

2021-10-18 10:32:57.290 Dean:    so, I have to implement a unicode aware text box
2021-10-18 10:32:19.750 Dean:    but the text input box does not
2021-10-18 10:32:11.550 Dean:    The read/write mechanism supports unicode

2021-10-17 22:18:54.780 Dean:    
2021-10-17 22:17:22.030 Dean:    is the problem scripting it to do so?
2021-10-17 22:17:09.960 Dean:    QT supposedly can export to MP3
2021-10-17 22:17:00.860 Dean:    
2021-10-17 22:15:44.860 Dean:    if we could get the os to do the recording assuming it can do it on its own
2021-10-17 22:14:54.450 Dean:    we did the same with speedfan to read the shared memory locations
2021-10-17 22:14:31.910 Dean:    might that be possible?
2021-10-17 22:14:20.410 Dean:    if we could write a little stub C program to do the recording?
2021-10-17 22:13:52.230 Dean:    or is it only because QT is scriptable?
2021-10-17 22:13:23.150 Dean:    or does the os only use QT to record?
2021-10-17 22:12:57.800 Dean:    is QT the only tool that can get the os to record?
2021-10-17 22:07:06.940 Dean:    Is there another tool that can record to mp3 files on osx?
2021-10-17 21:59:29.290 Dean:    you can't ask QT to output to mp3?
2021-10-17 21:58:52.700 Dean:    they seem to say use another tool such as VLC
2021-10-17 21:58:36.410 Dean:    a quick look on the web does not pop up anything obvious that allows VB6 to read mp4 files
2021-10-17 21:53:50.590 Dean:    but I doubt I will be able to handle .mp4a files without a struggle
2021-10-17 21:53:07.550 Dean:    I can handle mp3
2021-10-17 19:19:15.590 Dean:    we'll have to give that a go later
2021-10-17 19:18:30.230 Dean:    it looks as if both google and onedrive can both share a folder
2021-10-17 19:06:12.830 Dean:    not suggesting
2021-10-17 19:06:08.070 Dean:    just thinking
2021-10-17 19:06:04.710 Dean:    and transfer via ftp...
2021-10-17 19:05:55.160 Dean:    we could even set up one of the clients as an FTP server!
2021-10-17 19:04:01.530 Dean:    but it is a thought
2021-10-17 19:03:48.940 Dean:    I do not know if the others mentioned can share a folder
2021-10-17 19:03:17.940 Dean:    I have the possibility of onedrive, google drive and dropbox on this PC
2021-10-17 19:02:55.700 Dean:    
2021-10-17 19:02:53.980 Dean:    for the moment though it might be sufficient just to have a tick box to disable Dropbox checks
2021-10-17 19:02:13.950 Dean:    We could have a radio button where we select the type of medium, once we know of others that could be suitable
2021-10-17 19:01:38.840 Dean:    
2021-10-17 19:01:33.310 Dean:    then we have the possibility of running FCW using any other newtork medium that can share drives
2021-10-17 19:01:00.020 Dean:    if I have a config item to test for Dropbox running or not that can be disabled
2021-10-17 19:00:30.050 Dean:    on FCW

2021-10-17 13:42:30.690 Dean:    but I do know that it has a side effect for VB6
2021-10-17 13:42:13.480 Dean:    to see if it cleaned up the recordings
2021-10-17 13:42:02.730 Dean:    and I was planning to change the recording frequency later
2021-10-17 13:41:47.660 Dean:    my logic is done with regard to recording the times
2021-10-17 13:41:23.320 Dean:    but sufficient
2021-10-17 13:41:19.070 Dean:    I and the quality is not good
2021-10-17 13:41:06.410 Dean:    yes they are recorded at 11kHz
2021-10-17 13:40:50.040 Dean:    Oh clever

2021-10-17 12:43:39.710 Dean:    so feel free to delete at will
2021-10-17 12:43:30.370 Dean:    otherwise Dropbox will be filled
2021-10-17 12:43:14.650 Dean:    We have to consider the voice recordings to be entirely temporary
2021-10-17 12:04:37.780 Dean:    only new recordings are played 'internally'
2021-10-17 12:04:16.990 Dean:    other .wav files that are manually attached are still played by the default application
2021-10-17 12:03:27.640 Dean:    s
2021-10-17 12:03:25.840 Dean:    very sendible with regard to the autoplay
2021-10-17 12:02:52.020 Dean:    I see it
2021-10-17 11:08:01.340 Dean:    it cuts off automatically at that point
2021-10-17 11:07:49.980 Dean:    maximum recording time is 65 seconds

2021-10-17 10:26:25.850 Dean:    jpegs though
2021-10-17 10:26:16.410 Dean:    lamps red/green lit/unlit &c
2021-10-17 10:26:00.680 Dean:    there will also be some jpgs in the resources/images folder for FCW

2021-10-17 09:35:58.400 Dean:    and use that to light the lamp for that number of seconds plus one.
2021-10-17 09:35:42.180 Dean:    when I play any recording, I take the length from the filename
2021-10-17 09:35:18.140 Dean:    and that is the recording length
2021-10-17 09:35:08.410 Dean:    I precede the filename with two digits
2021-10-17 09:34:49.590 Dean:    when I create a unique name for the file
2021-10-17 09:34:33.730 Dean:    and count the seconds
2021-10-17 09:34:26.190 Dean:    during recording I time the recording session using a timer
2021-10-17 09:34:10.670 Dean:    when playing
2021-10-17 09:34:02.630 Dean:    in order to light the 'play' lamp
2021-10-17 09:33:48.690 Dean:    it just plays it and is done with it
2021-10-17 09:33:34.210 Dean:    because Windows does not tell me when a recording ends

2021-10-14 11:23:37.480 Dean:    I'd like you to test FCW for me
2021-10-12 14:04:02.280 Dean:    not required
2021-10-12 14:03:57.250 Dean:    can you let me know if you CAN make jFC read WAV files, it would be nice
2021-10-12 14:03:31.960 Dean:    not a lot
2021-10-12 13:32:17.920 Dean:    so if I have to convert to MP3 that will take some coding
2021-10-12 13:32:04.760 Dean:    VB6 is not natively MP3
2021-10-12 13:31:52.850 Dean:    I know it can handle MP3
2021-10-12 13:31:42.860 Dean:    I forget
2021-10-12 13:31:39.860 Dean:    So, the question, can jFC read and play .WAV files?
2021-10-12 10:17:20.480 Dean:    just ruggedising it
2021-10-12 09:57:57.860 Dean:    I have tested FCW successfully on 32bit and 64 bit windows
2021-10-11 11:13:20.540 Dean:    just making some changes to ensure FCW works when I give it to you to test
2021-10-11 11:12:52.610 Dean:    Is the weather bearable where you are?
2021-10-10 13:12:20.000 Dean:    an easy addition
2021-10-10 13:12:01.200 Dean:    and just ensuring it all works
2021-10-10 13:11:52.090 Dean:    I am amending the help for FCW now
2021-10-10 13:11:36.690 Dean:    (23 secs) or similar

2021-10-10 13:11:20.800 Dean:    it will probably have the number of seconds afterwards as well indicating the length
2021-10-10 13:11:00.730 Dean:    that appears here as "New Recording: nnnnnnn.wav"
2021-10-10 13:09:38.000 Dean:    and are sent using < r >< r >

2021-10-10 13:09:16.160 Dean:    to tell Windows to record and save
2021-10-10 13:09:02.390 Dean:    and a few calls to mciSendString
2021-10-10 13:08:46.040 Dean:    the addition of an API
2021-10-10 13:08:37.170 Dean:    The code was very simple to implement
2021-10-10 13:08:07.500 Dean:    the max that a VB6 timer can do
2021-10-10 13:07:59.510 Dean:    there is a timer that ends the recording automatically after 65 secs
2021-10-10 13:07:44.850 Dean:    the button left is record, right stops the recording

2021-10-05 17:17:51.750 Dean:    
2021-10-05 17:17:50.560 Dean:    just clutching at straws
2021-10-05 17:17:27.160 Dean:    in comparison to DropBox and Mac?
2021-10-05 17:17:10.270 Dean:    could it be due to the way that Windows and Dropbox interact?
2021-10-05 17:16:30.330 Dean:    it is most strange
2021-10-05 17:16:25.980 Dean:    and that is the workaround
2021-10-05 17:16:16.020 Dean:    so we just add a hard cRLf
2021-10-05 17:15:55.410 Dean:    it seems not...
2021-10-05 17:15:00.540 Dean:    and why it was not happening on Mac?
2021-10-05 17:14:39.450 Dean:    so did you figure out why jFC win was having a problem with the EOLs?
2021-10-05 17:14:02.270 Dean:    all good!
2021-10-05 17:12:27.570 Dean:    Awake response. Request time: Tue, 05 Oct 2021 16:48:32 GMT-1

2021-10-05 13:56:09.570 Dean:    making progress?
2021-10-05 13:50:20.960 Dean:    all well?

2021-10-05 12:20:58.680 Dean:    you may need to revisit that description as my text will be an approximation
2021-10-05 12:20:31.960 Dean:    
2021-10-05 12:20:24.930 Dean:    CRLF to each line.
2021-10-05 12:20:24.850 Dean:    The solution is to strip the original EOL from each line and write a hard-coded 
2021-10-05 12:20:24.720 Dean:    
2021-10-05 12:20:24.610 Dean:    Windows writes the EOL differently with the same data source.
2021-10-05 12:20:24.520 Dean:    code running on the Mac reads and writes CRLF correctly whilst the same code on
2021-10-05 12:20:24.440 Dean:    VB6 program seeing an absence or corruption of the EOL data. It seems that the

2021-10-05 12:20:24.140 Dean:    widget writes text data using CRLF as the EOL. On Windows using VB6 and ADO to
2021-10-05 12:20:24.050 Dean:    The same code on Mac and Win results in a different EOL when run on Windows. The

2021-10-05 12:20:23.870 Dean:    11.0 Writing a UTF8 file with CRLF EOL
2021-10-05 12:20:20.490 Dean:    I have modified the YWE bugs text file on DB
2021-10-05 11:41:21.880 Dean:    quite a good one though
2021-10-05 11:41:02.820 Dean:    it is a puzzler
2021-10-05 11:33:18.520 Dean:    and it is not some recent change
2021-10-05 11:33:06.860 Dean:    at least we will be aware that jFCWin has always done this
2021-10-05 11:32:48.360 Dean:    and see what that does?
2021-10-05 11:32:40.940 Dean:    can you also please try an older version of jFC on Windows
2021-10-05 11:31:29.070 Dean:    good luck
2021-10-05 11:31:26.960 Dean:    back later!
2021-10-05 11:31:22.500 Dean:    right, I have to go out for a short while
2021-10-05 11:30:14.550 Dean:    it only seems to occur shortly after the the first line is written
2021-10-05 11:29:26.800 Dean:    e
2021-10-05 11:29:25.760 Dean:    so the test is a good onw
2021-10-05 11:29:18.050 Dean:    and exclude all the dross that happened before
2021-10-05 11:29:06.940 Dean:    all we need to do is to make it simple enough to see the change
2021-10-05 11:28:46.470 Dean:    we juts proved that
2021-10-05 11:28:41.120 Dean:    because there is a physical difference
2021-10-05 11:28:29.530 Dean:    I think it will become apparent then
2021-10-05 11:28:17.450 Dean:    can you compare that easily?
2021-10-05 11:28:06.630 Dean:    on a very simple two line write with no other data?
2021-10-05 11:27:51.540 Dean:    and the result in the output file itself?
2021-10-05 11:27:10.420 Dean:    but when writing?
2021-10-05 11:27:00.380 Dean:    
2021-10-05 11:26:37.070 Dean:    is rather ugly
2021-10-05 11:26:37.070 Dean:    I can always change my config to have a third option to force the use of non-utf8 when talking to jFc on Win but that 
2021-10-05 11:25:57.610 Dean:    
2021-10-05 11:25:31.230 Dean:    or some other character that is getting mixed up with it
2021-10-05 11:25:12.600 Dean:    it must be to do with EoL
2021-10-05 11:24:55.360 Dean:    and see what it produces without all the confusion
2021-10-05 11:24:39.320 Dean:    entriely blank
2021-10-05 11:24:31.890 Dean:    perhaps start with an empty unchanged file on each?
2021-10-05 11:24:05.210 Dean:    can you od exactly the same on jFC on win and Mac and compare the output?
2021-10-05 11:23:42.720 Dean:    
2021-10-05 11:22:59.940 Dean:    will be skipped
2021-10-05 11:22:54.850 Dean:    so a mistaken CR on its own
2021-10-05 11:22:41.610 Dean:    or an EOL that is does not count as an a EoL
2021-10-05 11:22:22.780 Dean:    when it encounters a malformed EOL
2021-10-05 11:22:11.780 Dean:    reading several lines as one
2021-10-05 11:22:04.180 Dean:    Well, looking around I see that the stream method of reading will cause just such a problem
2021-10-05 11:21:32.540 Dean:    
2021-10-05 11:21:12.390 Dean:    is that just a copy /paste artefact?
2021-10-05 11:20:58.020 Dean:    it has 57.429 Harry Win in front of it
2021-10-05 11:20:37.730 Dean:    "The weeding the garden" text
2021-10-05 11:20:17.120 Dean:    nothing concatenated
2021-10-05 11:20:10.060 Dean:    all looks good at the moment
2021-10-05 11:19:39.160 Dean:    so it writes accordingly
2021-10-05 11:19:28.540 Dean:    I need to do that to read your text when it is concatenated
2021-10-05 11:19:11.110 Dean:    I am able to switch from ANSI to UTF8 at a buttonpress
2021-10-05 11:06:14.000 Dean:    I see that when reading in both utf8 and ANSI
2021-10-05 11:04:37.220 Dean:    in your file
2021-10-05 11:04:19.860 Dean:    I see that as your last sent line when I read the first line
2021-10-05 11:03:42.310 Dean:    "2021-10-05 10:55:47.001 HarryWin:    57.429 HarryWin:    Weeding the garden,  it is decent enough day for it."
2021-10-05 11:00:45.620 Dean:    but it has no problem when reading from jFC on MAc
2021-10-05 11:00:11.130 Dean:    in that there is something that makes it miss the EoL after a recent read of new data
2021-10-05 10:59:38.510 Dean:    meaning that it is FCW's understanding of jFC Wins data
2021-10-05 10:59:14.940 Dean:    it is not static in the file
2021-10-05 10:58:59.150 Dean:    but the corruption moves
2021-10-05 10:58:51.850 Dean:    FCW does not like the output from jFC Win
2021-10-05 10:58:23.730 Dean:    The corruption is only an apparent one
2021-10-05 10:56:59.130 Dean:    and then revert to Mac
2021-10-05 10:56:47.530 Dean:    Can you please close jFCWin
2021-10-05 10:55:38.410 Dean:    .LineSeparator = -1 ' adCRLF 'vbCrLf
2021-10-05 10:55:19.060 Dean:    the other options for line separator are LF and CR only
2021-10-05 10:54:58.140 Dean:    but it does not see them when reading from jFCWin
2021-10-05 10:54:31.430 Dean:    it is set to use crLF as the line separator
2021-10-05 10:54:08.200 Dean:    I follow the code and it simply does a read of a  line
2021-10-05 10:53:45.020 Dean:    and all lines in between are on one line
2021-10-05 10:53:27.700 Dean:    and then the preceding line starts "Anything?"
2021-10-05 10:53:11.020 Dean:    I see your last line
2021-10-05 10:52:25.230 Dean:    all of that was concatenated into one line
2021-10-05 10:51:52.250 Dean:    jFC on Win seems to be producing no recognisable EOL
2021-10-05 10:51:19.660 Dean:    Well,
2021-10-05 10:46:34.660 Dean:    I will watch them come in , line by line
2021-10-05 10:46:11.260 Dean:    but all the lines are concatenated
2021-10-05 10:45:59.750 Dean:    not an EOS
2021-10-05 10:45:43.140 Dean:    immediately I see a problem
2021-10-05 10:45:23.950 Dean:    how are you win PC?
2021-10-05 10:45:13.770 Dean:    good morning
2021-10-05 10:44:08.460 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:44:07.070 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8djCvcLmAQ
2021-10-05 10:44:05.130 Dean:    this chap is quite good
2021-10-05 10:43:56.710 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:42:09.660 Dean:    in utf8 mode
2021-10-05 10:41:50.260 Dean:    I am in the IDE
2021-10-05 10:35:14.090 Dean:    and see it encounter an EOS or not as the case may be
2021-10-05 10:34:59.600 Dean:    and I'll run FCW in the IDE
2021-10-05 10:34:50.100 Dean:    let me know when you are going to start
2021-10-05 10:34:32.770 Dean:    and see if the problem is replicated
2021-10-05 10:34:21.330 Dean:    might be a good idea for you to tun jFC on Win first
2021-10-05 10:33:29.730 Dean:    OK
2021-10-05 10:32:28.300 Dean:    I think it is a weird char that is being inserted
2021-10-05 10:31:52.340 Dean:    the EOS appears to be real
2021-10-05 10:31:36.060 Dean:    and that is before I do any filtering
2021-10-05 10:31:20.770 Dean:    prematurely
2021-10-05 10:31:14.480 Dean:    then come to EOS, end of stream
2021-10-05 10:31:06.040 Dean:    I see it loop for a few lines
2021-10-05 10:30:57.260 Dean:    running in the IDE
2021-10-05 10:30:51.880 Dean:    when I watch the code
2021-10-05 10:30:46.130 Dean:    and then write an array
2021-10-05 10:30:40.540 Dean:    All I do here is to read the file line by line, exclude the BOM by filtering from position 3
2021-10-05 10:30:07.610 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:29:56.380 Dean:    and let us see what occurs
2021-10-05 10:29:49.950 Dean:    is for you to run jFC on Win
2021-10-05 10:29:42.270 Dean:    a simple test
2021-10-05 10:29:38.120 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:29:35.100 Dean:    and I can only read a few lines until I reach a char.
2021-10-05 10:29:14.840 Dean:    I run FCW in utf8 mode
2021-10-05 10:29:01.880 Dean:    but
2021-10-05 10:29:00.230 Dean:    if I run jFC on Win the output is created and it is all good
2021-10-05 10:28:29.770 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:28:29.090 Dean:    sort but I suppose a BOM makes sense
2021-10-05 10:28:29.090 Dean:    I will not leap to conclusions at this point that it is a BOM being produced but there may be a weird char. of some 
2021-10-05 10:27:44.500 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:27:41.650 Dean:    and not jFC on MAc
2021-10-05 10:27:05.090 Dean:    it appears, so far to be a characteristic of jFC on Win
2021-10-05 10:26:42.210 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:26:39.230 Dean:    and previously it appeared in your file when you ran jFC on Win
2021-10-05 10:26:23.100 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:26:21.730 Dean:    as it appeared yesterday in my output file after jFC was run
2021-10-05 10:25:54.950 Dean:    now, in any case it was a possible BOM or weird char produced by jFC that seemed to be culprit
2021-10-05 10:25:13.140 Dean:    
2021-10-05 10:25:08.980 Dean:    which excludes the BOM
2021-10-05 10:24:58.160 Dean:    but, FCW should not be producing BOMs anymore as they are filtered out by writing a binary stream at position 3
2021-10-05 10:24:14.570 Dean:    understood
2021-10-04 20:45:24.770 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2021-10-04 20:45:19.950 Dean:    putting Mum to bed can be interesting
2021-10-04 20:44:59.890 Dean:    I may not be able to come back to laptop
2021-10-04 20:40:59.990 Dean:    Bu@@ering off out for a bit.
2021-10-04 20:32:15.200 Dean:    an interesting issue at least
2021-10-04 20:31:55.060 Dean:    and I suppose the earlier corruptions I saw in your file were caused by running jFC on Windows on your Dell
2021-10-04 20:31:18.520 Dean:    meaning that it undoes whatever jFC has just done
2021-10-04 20:30:51.570 Dean:    when I switch modes on FCW, I rewrite my file
2021-10-04 20:28:57.430 Dean:    jFC on Windows is definitely doing something differently to jFC on Mac
2021-10-04 20:26:41.680 Dean:    so, it seems that when writing the file using jFC it writes a char that indicates the EoS to FCW
2021-10-04 20:25:55.750 Dean:    and all is well again
2021-10-04 20:25:49.260 Dean:    I switch back to UTF8 mode
2021-10-04 20:25:32.900 Dean:    I switch to FSO mode and I can read everything
2021-10-04 20:25:11.840 Dean:    cannnot see the rest of my output file prior to the jFC running
2021-10-04 20:24:45.390 Dean:    problems now on FCW after I close jFC and re-open FCW
2021-10-04 20:23:49.085 JS Fire Call:    test jfc

2021-10-04 20:09:41.530 Dean:    FCW is now reading things normally
2021-10-04 20:09:28.560 Dean:    that line...
2021-10-04 20:09:10.760 Dean:    all good

2021-10-04 20:07:15.980 Dean:    I want to see if that makes a difference
2021-10-04 20:06:44.610 Dean:    Can you remove the HarryWin line?
2021-10-04 20:06:11.480 Dean:    but in UTF8 mode they are concatenated
2021-10-04 20:05:59.780 Dean:    I can read them perfectly well when in normal reading mode
2021-10-04 20:05:08.320 Dean:    are all concatenated
2021-10-04 20:05:01.530 Dean:    the lines "Are you running jFC - that does not look right" to "I'm getting your messages OK on mac and win."
2021-10-04 20:03:08.400 Dean:    but I see some strangeness in your file
2021-10-04 20:02:46.590 Dean:    then all was well again
2021-10-04 20:02:39.380 Dean:    I restarted,
2021-10-04 20:02:34.970 Dean:    and I saw only the first two lines of each input and output file
2021-10-04 20:02:17.620 Dean:    then I closed it and ran FCW
2021-10-04 20:02:10.870 Dean:    only occurred after running jFC and when it responded to PINGs/AWAKEs

2021-10-04 19:59:30.120 Dean:    hold on
2021-10-04 19:59:27.270 Dean:    looks like this:
2021-10-04 19:59:12.670 Dean:    your third most recent line
2021-10-04 19:58:52.820 Dean:    when viewed from FCW
2021-10-04 19:58:43.050 Dean:    and I have what looks like a corruption in your file

2021-10-04 19:57:40.900 Dean:    I am going to stay on FCW for now...
2021-10-04 19:57:19.090 Dean:    I just closed and re-opened FCW
2021-10-04 19:56:56.510 Dean:    what is going on?
2021-10-04 19:56:52.050 Dean:    and then it is sorted!
2021-10-04 19:56:33.880 Dean:    as it is seeing an EoS just after two lines on each input and output
2021-10-04 19:56:06.790 Dean:    but now FCW is unhappy

2021-10-04 19:32:20.930 Dean:    as I have not run jFC for a couple of days

2021-10-04 18:05:29.590 Dean:    then will start on the next problem
2021-10-04 18:05:12.440 Dean:    still just testing until I feel happy that it works without a problem
2021-10-04 18:04:53.100 Dean:
2021-10-04 18:04:43.390 Dean:    I have also updated the help for FCW and changed some of the wording on the new radio button options
2021-10-04 18:04:15.050 Dean:    easy to do and quickish to make
2021-10-04 18:04:06.180 Dean:    prawns, chicken and pea stir fry with egg noodles
2021-10-04 15:29:10.830 Dean:    and displayed them properly
2021-10-04 15:29:04.560 Dean:    By the way, FCW could see those chars you sent yesterday
2021-10-04 15:28:33.600 Dean:    Ha!
2021-10-04 15:26:28.950 Dean:    how's the tidying progressing?

2021-10-04 14:05:04.630 Dean:    I have added a configuration option in the prefs to allow selection of utf8/ANSI
2021-10-04 14:03:53.080 Dean:    I'll make no other logic changes until I have tested it a bit
2021-10-04 14:03:19.390 Dean:    and so far it is doing its job
2021-10-04 14:03:10.510 Dean:    but I have put some validations around my code
2021-10-04 14:02:56.720 Dean:    that could have been because I was running it in the IDE
2021-10-04 14:02:34.210 Dean:    and it is not having the problems it was having yesterday
2021-10-04 14:02:19.390 Dean:    it does not correct my typos
2021-10-04 14:02:08.890 Dean:    and it is doing, withthe new method, wha the old one was doing, but now utf8-ish
2021-10-04 14:01:40.700 Dean:    fr the moment, the program seems stable

2021-10-04 10:31:55.050 Dean:    oh yes, no change there

2021-10-03 11:42:25.019 JS Fire Call:    just fired up jFC
2021-10-03 11:40:57.430 Dean:    worth recommending
2021-10-03 11:40:51.950 Dean:    but it is a very good app in itself
2021-10-03 11:40:32.250 Dean:    and when I paste from it, the extra LF appear

2021-10-03 11:12:09.200 Dean:    ?
2021-10-03 11:12:05.930 Dean:    could you load cintanotes on your PC, dump some text into that and see what it does when copying/pasteing into jFC
2021-10-03 11:11:24.180 Dean:    do you do any of that?
2021-10-03 11:11:16.800 Dean:    I may have to identify and strip certain crlf when I encounter them

2021-10-03 11:09:35.510 Dean:    We have found some musical programs that mum loves
2021-10-03 11:09:34.010 Dean:
2021-10-03 11:09:09.110 Dean:    especially when copying multiple lines
2021-10-03 11:08:58.820 Dean:    the program does feel snappier
2021-10-03 11:08:47.060 Dean:    so the program is now operating too quickly
2021-10-03 11:08:28.340 Dean:    program's requests
2021-10-03 11:08:28.340 Dean:    the stream method of writing output is happening so fast that the o/s may not be quick enough to carry out the
2021-10-03 11:07:28.410 Dean:    I can see the end
2021-10-03 11:05:24.540 Dean:    one step closer to implementing utf8
2021-10-03 11:05:14.490 Dean:
2021-10-03 11:05:09.020 Dean:    but that fixes the file write error I am encountering
2021-10-03 11:04:53.550 Dean:    I will add a get-out to the loop just in case it locks forever
2021-10-03 11:04:28.090 Dean:    and loops until it is closed
2021-10-03 11:04:20.280 Dean:    and that test is called and captures occasions when the file is still open
2021-10-03 11:03:38.150 Dean:    not had to do that ever before
2021-10-03 11:03:30.010 Dean:    so, I have added a while/wend loop to test if the file is open or closed just before I attempt the next write
2021-10-03 11:02:48.800 Dean:    is certainly taking longer to close the file than the program is taking to issue open/close commands
2021-10-03 11:02:48.800 Dean:    so it seems to be taking a while to write the new stream to the file and close it, the task being perfroemd by the o/s
2021-10-03 11:01:49.390 Dean:    and in the IDE if I simply proceed with the same line immediately the error occurs it works
2021-10-03 11:01:22.190 Dean:    3004
2021-10-03 11:01:19.120 Dean:    and it occasionally and randomly fails with a 30004 error
2021-10-03 11:01:00.620 Dean:    I am now writing test files using the new utf8 method
2021-10-03 11:00:34.180 Dean:    one at a time, in a loop
2021-10-03 11:00:25.750 Dean:    and sends each line to the same routine
2021-10-03 11:00:12.030 Dean:    when I have multiple lines the program breaks the chunk into lines
2021-10-03 10:59:42.290 Dean:    I have a function that takes input and writes it to the file line by line
2021-10-03 10:59:15.220 Dean:    I have the bug cornered and killed

2021-10-03 10:30:50.540 Dean:    that has nothing to do with the new method of reading/writing

2021-10-03 10:29:11.610 Dean:    if I only append crlf those spaces do not appear
2021-10-03 10:28:55.970 Dean:    that is the result of copying from cintanotes and appending vbcrlf

2021-10-02 23:09:09.372 Dean:    you could synch the MAC/PC versions of jFC
2021-10-02 23:08:47.809 Dean:    if you stored a copy of your settings on the exchange location
2021-10-02 23:08:15.202 Dean:    so that it does not generate a series of responses to old PINGs and AWAKEs
2021-10-02 23:07:43.422 Dean:    one good thing about writing the settings to an INI is that you can easily copy them to the windows box
2021-10-02 23:06:10.034 Dean:    and I have managed to make things work to a certain extent with utf8

2021-10-02 22:23:08.250 Dean:    and if I want it, I have to go right round the all the houses
2021-10-02 22:22:48.010 Dean:    basically VB6 does not have utf8 support by default
2021-10-02 22:08:05.060 Dean:    and I will document what I have done and why
2021-10-02 22:07:52.010 Dean:    the reading seems OK
2021-10-02 22:07:43.020 Dean:
2021-10-02 22:07:40.880 Dean:    or find what I am doing wrong
2021-10-02 22:07:33.220 Dean:    or a workaround
2021-10-02 22:07:21.800 Dean:    and add some controlling code to it
2021-10-02 22:07:03.480 Dean:    but I need to understand why
2021-10-02 22:06:53.440 Dean:    as I am not using it to write the output file
2021-10-02 22:06:41.800 Dean:    it does not matter at the moment
2021-10-02 22:06:27.800 Dean:    that earlier caused a corruption
2021-10-02 22:06:19.800 Dean:    as I am on occasion receiving that same error
2021-10-02 22:06:04.630 Dean:    there are still problems to be dealt with
2021-10-02 22:05:43.250 Dean:    and it also is quicker
2021-10-02 22:05:36.410 Dean:    and hopefully excludes the possibility of non utf8 chars causing a problem
2021-10-02 22:05:15.750 Dean:    but it works
2021-10-02 22:05:03.050 Dean:    it is very messy
2021-10-02 22:04:49.660 Dean:    and has side effects such as our earlier corruption
2021-10-02 22:04:21.040 Dean:    it is much more complicated than a normal open/read/write close
2021-10-02 22:04:01.970 Dean:
2021-10-02 22:03:59.870 Dean:    it has taken a long while to understand the peculiarities of the method
2021-10-02 22:03:38.830 Dean:    and then I can write the file
2021-10-02 22:03:32.000 Dean:    the resulting stream is BOM free
2021-10-02 22:03:19.270 Dean:    where the BOM is excluded by the position param setting it to 3
2021-10-02 22:03:00.640 Dean:    and then copy the stream in memory to another stream
2021-10-02 22:02:45.590 Dean:    I have to write to a utf8 stream with the BOM
2021-10-02 22:02:31.110 Dean:    when writing it is more complex
2021-10-02 22:02:17.850 Dean:    and that gets rid of all spurious chars when reading
2021-10-02 22:01:57.730 Dean:    there is a position param that has to be set to 2 on a read
2021-10-02 22:01:34.240 Dean:    and interprets the first few chars as such
2021-10-02 22:01:20.170 Dean:    and with default read params expects the first two bytes as a BOM
2021-10-02 22:00:54.230 Dean:    as I read all the lines using a new method which tries to write a BOM when writing a file
2021-10-02 22:00:17.470 Dean:    and that was a problem for a while
2021-10-02 22:00:00.890 Dean:    I am reading all files using the new method
2021-10-02 21:57:53.730 Dean:    123
2021-10-02 21:57:09.300 Dean:    testing
2021-10-02 21:05:26.740 Dean:    if you want me to corrupt a timestamp to test, just say!
2021-10-02 20:57:30.040 Dean:    and I cannot remember if it only affects Mac
2021-10-02 20:57:07.090 Dean:    the cacheing is an o/s thing
2021-10-02 20:34:52.260 Dean:    to that file only
2021-10-02 20:34:43.950 Dean:    and the corruption may be limited
2021-10-02 20:34:30.780 Dean:    I think I will only write the file with utf8 suffix
2021-10-02 20:33:53.510 Dean:    and then I can start to test
2021-10-02 20:33:45.100 Dean:    I have a button that can be pressed to switch from the normal mode to utf8
2021-10-02 20:33:01.670 Dean:    I sent you a settings.ini file
2021-10-02 20:32:52.600 Dean:    or write the data elsewhere
2021-10-02 20:32:43.580 Dean:    I think you need to cater for that event occurring again
2021-10-02 20:32:24.180 Dean:    otherwise would not let you?
2021-10-02 20:32:08.600 Dean:    thank goodness for that
2021-10-02 20:11:12.410 Dean:    aggressive cacheing you cannot control is a real pain
2021-10-02 20:10:43.820 Dean:    but if I were you I'd transfer to Windows
2021-10-02 20:10:19.930 Dean:    not able to diagnose why at the moment
2021-10-02 20:10:05.380 Dean:    then it continued
2021-10-02 20:09:53.960 Dean:    and an error occurred when writing the stream
2021-10-02 20:09:38.980 Dean:    Reason for the corruption : I was testing writing using the new method
2021-10-02 20:09:17.640 Dean:
2021-10-02 20:08:22.490 Dean:    and then reboot the MAc
2021-10-02 20:08:16.610 Dean:    I'd switch to Windows for the time being
2021-10-02 20:07:45.130 Dean:    <><>settings.ini
2021-10-02 20:07:15.620 Dean:    you can write a JSON file or be compatible with mine so that it reads the INI
2021-10-02 20:06:44.300 Dean:    I am writing the .ini file
2021-10-02 20:06:25.240 Dean:    causes more trouble than it is worth
2021-10-02 20:06:13.560 Dean:    Time to dump the prefs I think
2021-10-02 19:49:56.730 Dean:    Are you having problems removing or refreshing the value?
2021-10-02 19:37:39.960 Dean:    hard to refresh when cached
2021-10-02 19:37:27.600 Dean:    those bloody prefs
2021-10-02 19:37:01.590 Dean:    so it has the corrupt timestamp or incorrect time stored
2021-10-02 19:36:28.630 Dean:    I assume you will guard against this happening? it must have failed at that timestamp and failed to proceed further
2021-10-02 19:35:01.820 Dean:    I see
2021-10-02 19:32:36.100 Dean:    Can you tell me where you think the invalid timestamp is?
2021-10-02 19:32:09.270 Dean:    That way, you always have a failsafe to prevent multiple responses
2021-10-02 19:31:30.200 Dean:    I think you need to do what I do and store the timestamps for each type and only respond to the most recent
2021-10-02 19:30:03.160 Dean:    timestamps are all correct at the moment as far as I can see
2021-10-02 19:28:57.220 Dean:    all looks good at this end
2021-10-02 19:27:33.000 Dean:    surely
2021-10-02 19:27:25.480 Dean:    it shouldn't do that though
2021-10-02 19:24:46.660 Dean:    That was strange
2021-10-02 19:21:02.760 Dean:    be
2021-10-02 19:21:01.290 Dean:    seems to going crazy
2021-10-02 19:20:30.680 Dean:    had not sent any pings
2021-10-02 19:20:15.420 Dean:    I just received some ping /awake responses
2021-10-02 19:20:00.390 Dean:    I am testing
2021-10-02 16:45:03.500 Dean:    reintroducing the utf8 code
2021-10-02 16:44:52.320 Dean:
2021-10-02 15:17:15.010 Dean:    so, it'll be a while before I have one
2021-10-02 15:16:56.040 Dean:    and have too much technology that is not replaceable
2021-10-02 15:16:33.930 Dean:    modern EVs are difficult to service deliberately
2021-10-02 15:16:05.200 Dean:    my bike has proven that to me
2021-10-02 15:15:53.310 Dean:    light, small, easy and quick to charge
2021-10-02 15:15:39.310 Dean:    a very good idea would be to start to create small one person cars suitable for the majority of travel
2021-10-02 15:15:10.740 Dean:    not happy about electric car manufacturing and infrastructure
2021-10-02 15:14:47.260 Dean:    hmmmm
2021-10-02 10:11:05.440 Dean:    What's the weather like today?
2021-10-02 10:11:02.940 Dean:    Hello!
2021-10-01 16:34:10.750 Dean:    a small chnage today, nothing interesting
2021-10-01 16:33:59.740 Dean:    off out myself
2021-10-01 14:59:51.820 Dean:    That's a clever kite
2021-10-01 14:37:55.410 Dean:    no kite flying since...
2021-10-01 14:37:33.210 Dean:    it was called Kitty, of course
2021-10-01 14:37:22.570 Dean:    lost my favourite kite in a strong wind even when using a 150lb string
2021-10-01 14:36:41.750 Dean:    I used to love kites when in my 20s
2021-10-01 13:08:30.960 Dean:    but in the process, I am learning new (to me ) technologies and methods
2021-10-01 13:07:59.060 Dean:    but possible
2021-10-01 13:07:42.630 Dean:    but modern capabilities are tricky to replicate
2021-10-01 13:07:21.460 Dean:    everything is possible
2021-10-01 13:07:16.110 Dean:    none of this stuff is simple when working with an old utility like VB6
2021-10-01 13:06:54.410 Dean:    until I am ready to slide it all into place
2021-10-01 13:06:38.780 Dean:    I think I will work on the the same file type with a utf8 suffix on the end for the output
2021-10-01 13:05:50.230 Dean:    and see how that goes
2021-10-01 13:05:39.300 Dean:    I will add the UTF8 stuff back in step by step now I know what the issues are
2021-10-01 12:46:17.140 Dean:    prior to that? email and the YWE forum.
2021-10-01 12:44:23.230 Dean:    and jFC
2021-10-01 12:44:15.720 Dean:    before fcw
2021-10-01 12:44:07.550 Dean:    kryptocat
2021-10-01 12:43:58.140 Dean:    certainly 2010
2021-10-01 12:43:46.550 Dean:    or 2009
2021-10-01 12:43:15.230 Dean:    2010
2021-10-04 20:23:35.395 JS Fire Call:    Ping response. Refresh Interval:15  OS:Windows  Version:2.6
2021-10-04 20:23:35.252 JS Fire Call:    Awake response. Request time: Mon, 04 Oct 2021 19:47:32 GMT
2021-10-01 12:43:13.380 Dean:    so when did we start?
2021-10-01 12:41:37.390 Dean:    and it took me a while to get that far
2021-10-01 12:41:21.850 Dean:    that is dated 2010 when we had the first real version
2021-10-01 12:41:04.310 Dean:    and if I look at the clock calendar, my first widget
2021-10-01 12:39:08.350 Dean:    I was at Windlesham in Sussex for 12 years
2021-10-01 12:38:48.540 Dean:    and we were talknin well before that
2021-10-01 12:38:39.090 Dean:    I have been here in Norfolk for 7.5 years
2021-10-01 12:38:10.210 Dean:    true!
2021-10-01 12:36:07.940 Dean:    how long have we been conversing now?
2021-10-01 12:35:57.020 Dean:    not to grow any older!
2021-10-01 11:04:11.820 Dean:    my bloody birthday
