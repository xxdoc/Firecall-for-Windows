2023-04-21 22:46:26.418 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2023-04-21 14:56:24.837 Dean:    I have made some improvements so time not wasted
2023-04-21 14:55:46.534 Dean:    the controls are not meant to be animated themselves
2023-04-21 14:55:29.703 Dean:    so, a no-go
2023-04-21 14:55:20.491 Dean:    e
2023-04-21 14:55:18.224 Dean:    if you do them avery now and again it is jerky
2023-04-21 14:55:05.397 Dean:    if they occur to frequently the loop is horribly slow
2023-04-21 14:54:46.467 Dean:    you have to add control and form.refreshes within the loop
2023-04-21 14:54:20.884 Dean:    V B6 does that stuff statically and does not show the result until the loop is done
2023-04-21 14:53:52.666 Dean:    I have to use a loop and then extend the height of the frame and the form itself
2023-04-21 14:53:24.123 Dean:    not on the whole form
2023-04-21 14:53:15.378 Dean:    in VB6 the scrolling is jerky and can't be done smoothly
2023-04-21 14:52:53.811 Dean:    on the prefs failed on smoothly scrolling the form bottom to match the height of the current pref tab as performed in YWE
2023-04-21 11:56:37.768 Dean:    it is an improved version of the prefs in FCW
2023-04-21 11:56:23.295 Dean:    at the moment it does not auto create from an XML file
2023-04-21 11:56:06.109 Dean:    and thinking as I create it
2023-04-21 11:55:55.810 Dean:    I am working on a quality prefs screen under VB6
2023-04-21 11:55:43.836 Dean:    understood
2023-04-21 11:06:59.556 Dean:    so, I will be working on that for a while
2023-04-21 11:06:46.163 Dean:    so, that bodes very well for steamydock
2023-04-21 11:06:30.273 Dean:    it was a rotating 3D object about 200 pixels square
2023-04-21 11:05:57.363 Dean:    and 7% GPU
2023-04-21 11:05:50.280 Dean:    and the example used 0% CPu
2023-04-21 11:05:37.022 Dean:    Tested it on my slow old laptop with a very poor and basic GPU
2023-04-21 11:05:12.699 Dean:    So I have a working example
2023-04-21 11:05:02.022 Dean:    I should be able to combine my code for a primitive dock using DirectX with the code to make the 3D object appear on the transparent background and be able to respond to mouse events
2023-04-21 11:03:48.062 Dean:    using DirectX8
2023-04-21 11:03:41.529 Dean:    I now have some example code for placing a 3D rotating object on a transparent desktop

2023-04-21 10:43:15.515 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-04-20 23:06:01.926 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2023-04-20 20:53:40.444 Dean:    it is what happens
2023-04-20 20:37:34.213 Dean:    as the controls are alien - so it can't help
2023-04-20 20:37:19.015 Dean:    when you create controls in code classes you really have to be aware of everything you are doing as the IDE is of no help whatsoever
2023-04-20 20:36:37.515 Dean:    once again this RC5/6 stuff
2023-04-20 20:36:22.905 Dean:    it was hours wasted
2023-04-20 20:36:09.122 Dean:    the frustration was such that I picked up the laptop and....
2023-04-20 20:35:46.929 Dean:    I had copied and pasted a declaration
2023-04-20 20:35:20.243 Dean:    but always incorrectly
2023-04-20 20:35:12.374 Dean:    a working and very similar type that allowed it to run and operate
2023-04-20 20:34:48.692 Dean:    in the end I had just declared a variable defining a form as the wrong type
2023-04-20 20:34:23.359 Dean:    I tested and recoded everything, cut and paste code into supposedly working programs
2023-04-20 20:33:53.482 Dean:    I had the same
2023-04-20 20:02:46.324 Dean:    only for advanced stuff that VB6 cannot do by default
2023-04-20 20:02:24.205 Dean:    IT is ONLY for advanced stuff and you'd want to avoid using it wherever possible
2023-04-20 20:01:52.962 Dean:     but it is as far from RAD as you can get
2023-04-20 20:01:38.701 Dean:    I succeeded
2023-04-20 20:01:33.801 Dean:    adding some text is painful, last attempt took me 30 mins
2023-04-20 20:01:17.202 Dean:    as each of the layers is self contained within its own class, all postioning is relative to the element
2023-04-20 20:00:43.175 Dean:    so, positioning anything is a matter of trial and error
2023-04-20 20:00:26.238 Dean:    you can only use the IDE for the integrated graphic framework
2023-04-20 20:00:11.354 Dean:    coding in VB6 using RC5 code generated forms is like coding in .js in that it has no IDE that you can use
2023-04-20 16:35:40.287 Dean:

2023-04-20 13:39:14.101 Dean:    cooler now
2023-04-20 12:03:29.388 Dean:    We'd have xml to JSON to VB6 by now
2023-04-20 12:03:06.724 Dean:    I wish you had taken up VB6!
2023-04-20 11:45:08.638 Dean:    my research so far tells me it isn't possible
2023-04-20 11:44:35.611 Dean:    if he says no, then I can move on without wasting too much time investigating
2023-04-20 11:44:08.598 Dean:    I tried using the usual methods and was unable to create a transparent background using the normal methods of calling APIs to make the main form transparent
2023-04-20 11:43:30.032 Dean:    so if he can answer positively and possibly provide an example as to how then I have a another route to investigate
2023-04-20 11:42:50.189 Dean:    he is the expert in that field with regard to VB6
2023-04-20 11:42:31.045 Dean:    whether it is possible to perform 2D animations using opaque elements on a transparent full screen form
2023-04-20 11:41:40.986 Dean:    I have contacted an expert in D3D directX using VB6 to ask him a simple question (I hope)
2023-04-20 11:41:09.435 Dean:    
2023-04-20 11:40:28.954 Dean:    <><>pzEarth-small.png
2023-04-20 11:11:28.171 Dean:    so there is a benefit
2023-04-20 11:11:20.469 Dean:    it uses 2-3% cpu compared to 10-12 for the rotating earth yahoo widget when in operation
2023-04-20 11:10:49.702 Dean:    
2023-04-20 11:10:48.132 Dean:    then I will have one working VB6 widget on the desktop
2023-04-20 11:10:31.093 Dean:    I'll probably tidy it up as an exercise to complete
2023-04-20 11:10:09.148 Dean:    does not save yet
2023-04-20 11:09:59.553 Dean:    And it finds/creates/reads/validates a settings.ini file
2023-04-20 11:09:07.102 Dean:    the VB6 widget has a template prefs with nothing working
2023-04-20 11:08:51.735 Dean:    <><>prefs.png
2023-04-20 11:08:16.229 Dean:    r
2023-04-20 11:08:13.613 Dean:    but I have plemty of simila 'wants'
2023-04-20 11:08:04.719 Dean:    I want to do it
2023-04-20 11:07:56.737 Dean:    no point in setting out on an exercise if it is not going to be used
2023-04-20 11:07:39.741 Dean:    but I am not going to step out on that path until the graphics are do-able
2023-04-20 11:07:16.310 Dean:    I am going to have to do the same with VB6 if I am going to prceed with the widget conversion
2023-04-20 11:06:46.005 Dean:    
2023-04-20 11:06:34.428 Dean:    are you planning to add radio buttons?
2023-04-20 11:06:20.005 Dean:    Do you have all the YWE prefs controls imitated?
2023-04-20 11:05:52.919 Dean:    
2023-04-20 11:05:22.589 Dean:    we are one step away...
2023-04-20 11:05:16.871 Dean:    if there were an option to allow clickthroughs when used in a graphical fashion - per VB6 layer then it would be a winner
2023-04-20 11:04:27.274 Dean:    so the two approaches do not work hand in hand
2023-04-20 11:04:04.938 Dean:    it is our use of graphics as controls where the boundary is the start of the transparency
2023-04-20 11:03:21.747 Dean:    click through elements on 'normal' form controls where the transparent areas allow click through to the underlayer would cause transparent buttons to click straight through
2023-04-20 11:02:15.940 Dean:    I understand the reasoning
2023-04-20 11:02:05.733 Dean:    but the complex widgets are a no-go
2023-04-20 11:01:49.220 Dean:    instead giving more menu options
2023-04-20 11:01:40.130 Dean:    I could probably even get the dials to work at a push using just the side switches and not the epins
2023-04-20 11:00:58.277 Dean:    or the kill button Xwidget
2023-04-20 11:00:32.854 Dean:    there is a lot of boilerplate code for the pz earth widget but once done can form a template for  simple widgets such as my earth, jupiter, saturn, stamp widgets that comprise a single image
2023-04-20 10:59:20.375 Dean:    so, simple widgets with simple graphical controls are possible and practical
2023-04-20 10:58:47.749 Dean:    The VB6 RC/Cairo future is still possible, just not possible for multi-layered widgets where the controls are on top of each other
2023-04-20 10:57:47.719 Dean:     Windspeed is 17 knots, force 5, direction NNE
2023-04-20 10:57:47.719 Dean:     Partly cloudy at 3000 ft.

2023-04-19 21:52:41.077 Dean:    perhaps you could use forth?
2023-04-19 21:52:29.508 Dean:    converting back and forth!
2023-04-19 21:51:12.160 Dean:    the prefs conversion looks good
2023-04-19 21:51:01.327 Dean:    
2023-04-19 21:50:30.365 Dean:    but I learnt a lot
2023-04-19 21:50:23.007 Dean:    three days wasted!
2023-04-19 21:50:17.303 Dean:    it is
2023-04-19 21:49:33.935 Dean:    IF you want a copy of the finished widget just say
2023-04-19 21:49:13.345 Dean:    he is very proud and haughty
2023-04-19 21:48:58.995 Dean:    the dev has been alerted but I doubt he will do anything about it
2023-04-19 21:48:41.265 Dean:    
2023-04-19 21:48:37.146 Dean:    and I'm fed up with kludges
2023-04-19 21:48:21.568 Dean:    but these are kludges
2023-04-19 21:48:14.115 Dean:    I could make the background surround into a surface and then place on top of that and it might help
2023-04-19 21:47:28.384 Dean:    as long as the controls do not overlap then it works
2023-04-19 21:46:59.548 Dean:    so, I can use Vb6 to make simple widgets without user interaction but the second you have to place a control on top of another it falls over
2023-04-19 21:46:09.935 Dean:    
2023-04-19 21:46:03.956 Dean:    but it does not handle the click throughs as we would expect
2023-04-19 21:45:47.223 Dean:    if there is a transparent path to desktop it lets the click through to that
2023-04-19 21:45:29.673 Dean:    
2023-04-19 21:45:20.932 Dean:    the topmost layer taking all the mouse events
2023-04-19 21:45:08.465 Dean:    it treats them as if a transparent solid
2023-04-19 21:44:57.128 Dean:    it cannot place layered PNGs  and handle the click throughs on transparent parts of the images
2023-04-19 21:44:23.853 Dean:    made good progress but failed in the end

2023-04-19 13:29:20.074 Dean:    just thinking
2023-04-19 13:29:10.324 Dean:    and then look for a better graphics solution that is GPU accelerated and multi-platform longer term
2023-04-19 13:28:22.217 Dean:    
2023-04-19 13:28:12.136 Dean:    I think that might be my interim path
2023-04-19 13:27:51.290 Dean:    so it would end up as a hybrid GDI+/Cairo program, non GPU optimised and only ever for Windows
2023-04-19 13:27:07.792 Dean:    
2023-04-19 13:27:00.133 Dean:    as if I switched over to  usingRC5/cairo for all 60-70 icons it would add a signicant CPU overhead
2023-04-19 13:26:24.430 Dean:    In this case I would leave the small icons alone to be rendered using the logic I have in place already
2023-04-19 13:25:51.941 Dean:    built into Cairo
2023-04-19 13:25:43.074 Dean:    and if I just used RC5 to handle the main animated image icons then I would gain access to a lot of animation functions
2023-04-19 13:24:54.835 Dean:    using RC5/cairo would mean I have some example boiler plate code that I can adapt  and learn from
2023-04-19 13:24:01.890 Dean:    
2023-04-19 13:23:53.909 Dean:    and I'd end up with just adding kludged complexity to this code
2023-04-19 13:23:06.345 Dean:    the boiler plate code I mean but the animation code would be complicated
2023-04-19 13:22:41.438 Dean:    VB6 with GDI+ is OK upto this point and is efficient but future advanced animations require more complexity some of which I have to implement anyway
2023-04-19 13:21:33.529 Dean:    I have been analysing the benefits of various combinations of tech with regard to SD and the future
2023-04-19 13:20:54.288 Dean:    
2023-04-19 11:48:40.142 Dean:    understood
2023-04-19 11:48:36.762 Dean:    [quote] At present these just print their parameters - don't actually make prefs on panes. [/quote]

2023-04-19 10:32:32.776 Dean:    A problem I am encountering with the VB6 pz earth
2023-04-19 10:32:15.172 Dean:    
2023-04-19 10:32:09.399 Dean:    just some thoughts whilst on the subject
2023-04-19 10:23:53.709 Dean:    just thinking
2023-04-19 10:23:18.817 Dean:    a plus or minus button that would allow you to add the contents of another field to a control as per the FCW Text prefs pane
2023-04-19 10:22:02.176 Dean:    to execute something in the prefs itself
2023-04-19 10:21:40.465 Dean:    I suppose it could simply run any command assigned in another field
2023-04-19 10:21:08.824 Dean:    Trying to think how a floating button control would work
2023-04-19 10:19:37.675 Dean:    floating ones not necessarily associated with a control
2023-04-19 10:19:16.585 Dean:    one thing that would have been useful was text boxes
2023-04-19 10:18:39.167 Dean:    the checkboxwas done in YWE I think, only the radio button was absent
2023-04-19 10:17:45.099 Dean:    a playsound button would be nice to have
2023-04-19 10:17:03.294 Dean:    as there is code and logic there
2023-04-19 10:16:55.089 Dean:    the texts page
2023-04-19 10:16:46.015 Dean:    there is only one pane that is really too unique and complicated for creating dynamically from a prefs generator
2023-04-19 10:16:04.477 Dean:    In my FCW config 
2023-04-19 10:14:34.368 Dean:    they need a frame around them to force a grouping of buttons to allow the selection of only one
2023-04-19 10:13:58.772 Dean:    perhaps radio buttons were too complex for the YWE devs
2023-04-19 10:13:09.039 Dean:    and ordinary buttons that can do something?
2023-04-19 10:12:37.308 Dean:    check boxes and radio buttons
2023-04-19 10:11:41.546 Dean:    those that it needed
2023-04-19 10:11:33.850 Dean:    you should probably add controls that the prefs does not have
2023-04-19 10:10:49.509 Dean:    so, it wouldn't be that hard
2023-04-19 10:10:31.228 Dean:    so that all reading/writing config should be done using JSON by default
2023-04-19 10:10:10.268 Dean:    s
2023-04-19 10:10:04.997 Dean:    the RC5 rich client framework providea a JSON parser
2023-04-19 10:09:43.666 Dean:    
2023-04-19 10:09:42.254 Dean:    so I could take the JSON and build a native binary prefs to interpret it
2023-04-19 10:09:15.985 Dean:    At least in VB6 I have the controls built-in to the IDE and the language graphics framework
2023-04-19 10:08:36.218 Dean:    u
2023-04-19 10:08:34.519 Dean:    That was one thing you couldn't do in YWE, use the in-bult prefs controls in yor own widgets
2023-04-19 10:07:49.152 Dean:    and the progress of the prefs.js?, are you going to be making your own controls for each potential element?
2023-04-19 10:06:46.193 Dean:    So, you have a JSON version of the XML file
2023-04-19 10:06:13.579 Dean:    been busy!
2023-04-19 10:06:09.297 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-04-17 22:13:29.908 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-04-17 21:46:25.868 Dean:    film recommendation: 3000 years of longing with Tilda Swinton
2023-04-17 21:46:01.646 Dean:    
2023-04-17 21:45:52.864 Dean:    give me an example
2023-04-17 16:09:24.386 Dean:    That's quite a job
2023-04-17 16:05:29.644 Dean:    I need to do the same for VB6
2023-04-17 16:05:21.800 Dean:    sensible
2023-04-17 15:41:58.879 Dean:    Blender
2023-04-17 15:41:54.834 Dean:    what a name?
2023-04-17 15:41:51.957 Dean:    digging out the PSD files for Blender
2023-04-17 15:41:38.772 Dean:    
2023-04-17 15:41:00.963 Dean:    dismantled the side gates and part built a new gate for the garden - far end
2023-04-17 15:40:21.428 Dean:    built the G5 with my newer faster motherboard, a transplant basically
2023-04-17 15:39:57.140 Dean:    
2023-04-17 15:39:41.108 Dean:    Good afternoon
2023-04-16 13:54:15.007 Dean:    the more I learn, the more I love YWE
2023-04-16 13:49:56.370 Dean:    it does not include the code to instantiate the class or create the form/window
2023-04-16 13:49:30.133 Dean:    This is the code behind a simple button
2023-04-16 13:49:14.235 Dean:    <><>cwSimpleButton.cls
2023-04-16 13:48:32.938 Dean:    \What i is teaching me is how much code there was behiind the scenes to display and handle a simple graphical object using the YWE
2023-04-16 11:07:24.060 Dean:    I am learning
2023-04-16 11:07:09.277 Dean:    
2023-04-16 11:07:04.937 Dean:    and then add events/actions
2023-04-16 11:06:54.381 Dean:    to make each work I will extract one by one and create a separate class for each
2023-04-16 11:06:30.327 Dean:    the other elements were all static
2023-04-16 11:06:20.732 Dean:    the 1st cut of the pz VB6 widget was a single 'widget' containing all the elements but with only one 'operating', ie the rotataing globe working on a timer
2023-04-16 11:05:20.787 Dean:    
2023-04-16 11:05:14.119 Dean:    experimenting
2023-04-16 11:05:10.433 Dean:    have to see howthe interaction occurs between widgets/child widgets
2023-04-16 11:04:46.307 Dean:    
2023-04-16 11:04:44.967 Dean:    but it is possible
2023-04-16 11:04:35.914 Dean:    I can do the same in VB6 but it is not recommended, I'll think about that
2023-04-16 11:04:12.096 Dean:    unfortunately they are menat to exist within each element's class whereas we defined them globally in the .js
2023-04-16 11:03:27.895 Dean:    that allows you to place the elements correctly so I am adapting the  .kon/.js item placements
2023-04-16 11:02:52.711 Dean:    there is no IDE currently
2023-04-16 11:02:42.588 Dean:    widgets areplaced on the form manually and can have child widgets
2023-04-16 11:02:17.005 Dean:    
2023-04-16 11:02:08.612 Dean:    I will have to create a standard 'widget' that has all the events within that itn can respond to
2023-04-16 11:01:38.313 Dean:    and contains the code needed to respond to an event, each of which needs to be manually created
2023-04-16 11:01:05.869 Dean:    each element is a 'widget' as opposed to a complete YWE widget
2023-04-16 11:00:33.692 Dean:    events/timers can set within each class
2023-04-16 10:59:55.236 Dean:    you will have a main form (mainWindow) then a class for a pin button or a globe
2023-04-16 10:59:01.955 Dean:    each element that needs to react to user triggered events needs to implemented as a separate class, so creating a simple button image object is possible but the boiler plate code has to be created for each element
2023-04-16 10:57:26.786 Dean:    I have been doing some investigation with the VB6 Cairo widgets
2023-04-16 10:57:03.071 Dean:    just
2023-04-16 10:56:57.897 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-04-15 22:41:19.212 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2023-04-15 22:40:52.397 Dean:    you don't want 30 taskbar entries
2023-04-15 22:40:38.196 Dean:    Re:vb6 pz widget, it had an entry in the windows taskbar and I've managed to remove that
2023-04-15 22:39:44.680 Dean:    ]
2023-04-15 22:39:42.773 Dean:    no obvious decline
2023-04-15 22:39:26.422 Dean:    well, your brain is still working
2023-04-15 22:39:14.741 Dean:    it
2023-04-15 22:39:11.923 Dean:    
2023-04-15 22:39:10.766 Dean:    and tit feels not so long ago
2023-04-15 22:38:55.186 Dean:    When you have memory of being 22
2023-04-15 22:38:42.541 Dean:    It always feels strange to have the age one wears
2023-04-15 22:38:20.533 Dean:    Happy birthday to you in 22 mins
2023-04-15 22:38:00.944 Dean:    Bloody hell
2023-04-15 22:37:56.116 Dean:    No.
2023-04-15 22:27:26.742 Dean:    this cheers me up no end
2023-04-15 22:27:19.800 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqTcHtSSfUE
2023-04-15 22:27:18.167 Dean:    
2023-04-15 22:23:49.955 Dean:    positively
2023-04-15 22:23:46.175 Dean:    I will respond
2023-04-15 22:20:31.129 Dean:    doing so now
2023-04-15 22:20:26.073 Dean:    not yet fired up email
2023-04-15 22:14:20.706 Dean:    what?
2023-04-15 22:14:15.539 Dean:    [quote] Did you see the email from Blender Bach? [/quote] 
2023-04-15 22:05:28.844 Dean:    and Node/web
2023-04-15 22:05:14.568 Dean:    and if we find a new .js desktop engine in the meantime then we can always use that!
2023-04-15 22:04:51.855 Dean:    almost all bases covered
2023-04-15 22:04:36.365 Dean:    then possibly 64bit/Cairo and eventually multi platform
2023-04-15 22:04:16.661 Dean:    and possibly VB6 32bit with Cairo
2023-04-15 22:03:50.091 Dean:    Xwidgets versions that run on Win and Linux/Wine
2023-04-15 22:03:31.841 Dean:    so far I have YWE Pz widgets for Win/Mac with some tribulation
2023-04-15 22:02:59.326 Dean:     and the idea of the widgets is not a dead one
2023-04-15 22:02:42.654 Dean:    native windows binary
2023-04-15 22:02:34.756 Dean:    the benefit is that it creates something that is similar in look and operation but that is it
2023-04-15 22:02:06.290 Dean:    that approaches what was easily do-able in YWE
2023-04-15 22:01:47.575 Dean:    For me, it is about being 'able' to do something with VB6
2023-04-15 22:01:20.940 Dean:    https://www.vbrichclient.com/#/en/About/
2023-04-15 22:00:54.856 Dean:    agreed
2023-04-15 21:07:40.309 Dean:    I seem to have leaped from 2000 to 2023!
2023-04-15 21:07:27.354 Dean:    with TwinBasic and Cairo 
2023-04-15 21:07:19.889 Dean:    and a future graphics tech is the next logical step
2023-04-15 21:07:02.260 Dean:    I am close
2023-04-15 21:06:59.100 Dean:    I have not been ready to embark on this route until I finished the dock
2023-04-15 21:06:43.083 Dean:    
2023-04-15 21:06:39.668 Dean:    I am the only VB6 widgeteer!
2023-04-15 21:06:31.953 Dean:    end result
2023-04-15 21:06:27.407 Dean:    and I'm not scared of digging into Windows to obvtain what I need
2023-04-15 21:06:13.791 Dean:    I have that now
2023-04-15 21:06:10.298 Dean:    and requires API knowledge
2023-04-15 21:06:01.921 Dean:    whilst VB6 is more monolithic
2023-04-15 21:05:52.703 Dean:    the widget engine was targetted at a market of smaller discrete programs
2023-04-15 21:05:23.276 Dean:    
2023-04-15 21:05:21.268 Dean:    they are also conventional devs and they do not have the graphical skills to equal what I produce
2023-04-15 21:04:55.871 Dean:    so others are reluctant to take it up
2023-04-15 21:04:45.068 Dean:    the developer of the Cairo wrapper, provides only a couple of DLLs and has not open sourced his code
2023-04-15 21:04:16.366 Dean:    are hardened, dyed in the wool types that take innovation poorly!
2023-04-15 21:03:53.415 Dean:    those that remain (there are still lots but not millions as there used to be)
2023-04-15 21:03:20.561 Dean:    the take up of this technology has been slow and the majority of devs these days have moved on from Vb6 for newer technologies (that MS has also abandoend)
2023-04-15 21:02:38.504 Dean:    No-one has done anything like 'our' widgets in VB6 as far as I am aware
2023-04-15 20:58:55.009 Dean:    and the technology is sufficiently different to make it a little of a struggle
2023-04-15 20:58:09.329 Dean:    it is a learning process and I'm not ready to do it properly
2023-04-15 20:57:52.303 Dean:    
2023-04-15 20:57:50.502 Dean:    what the performance is and how easy it is to replicate the functionality in YWE
2023-04-15 20:57:31.532 Dean:    to see if it is the future, how hard it is &c
2023-04-15 20:57:18.177 Dean:    and the point at the moment is just to dip my toe in the water of "richclient" 5/6 and Cairo
2023-04-15 20:56:41.557 Dean:    the trouble is, doing things the 'proper' way, the way I ought to do it won't see results quickly
2023-04-15 20:55:25.281 Dean:    but once one has been built the others will be much easier
2023-04-15 20:55:11.421 Dean:    it is quite a job
2023-04-15 20:55:03.269 Dean:    it was in my mind as I set about building all the components for a VB6 widget
2023-04-15 20:54:37.628 Dean:    I am thinking about that sort of thing now
2023-04-15 20:25:55.969 Dean:    h
2023-04-15 20:25:52.057 Dean:    it is comparable or peraps even slightly less onerous
2023-04-15 20:25:36.163 Dean:    I did not want it to use more resources than a YW.
2023-04-15 20:25:12.048 Dean:    so that's good
2023-04-15 20:25:04.365 Dean:    it is meagre on CPU usage
2023-04-15 20:24:39.069 Dean:    it responds to a click, stopping the rotation
2023-04-15 20:24:13.962 Dean:    looks alright
2023-04-15 20:24:09.363 Dean:    the earth rotates at a 120ms interval
2023-04-15 20:23:56.210 Dean:    menu items all work, sounds play as per the widgets
2023-04-15 20:23:40.876 Dean:    I have made progress on my 1st VB6 pz widget
2023-04-15 20:23:26.283 Dean:     
2023-04-15 19:06:58.887 Dean:    swine
2023-04-14 22:08:19.606 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-04-14 20:50:15.122 Dean:    me and life
2023-04-14 20:50:11.282 Dean:    slow here
2023-04-14 16:54:24.405 Dean:    no rain here - just overcast
2023-04-14 16:16:51.331 Dean:    pa
2023-04-14 16:16:49.915 Dean:    to comapre and test
2023-04-14 16:16:39.832 Dean:    and Steamydock on the right
2023-04-14 16:16:33.276 Dean:    I have Rocketdock on the left hand monitor
2023-04-14 16:16:16.927 Dean:    also useful for testing change of resolutions &c
2023-04-14 16:16:04.941 Dean:    nice to have a second screen on the old laptop, makes development and testing much easier
2023-04-14 16:15:36.464 Dean:    just upgraded my laptop second monitor to a 1440 x 900 22" version. Previously it was a 19"
2023-04-14 14:24:12.526 Dean:    if it still exists by then
2023-04-14 14:24:06.253 Dean:     and possibly os X
2023-04-14 14:23:53.225 Dean:    and there exists the possibility of running TwinBasic on Linux using Cairo graphics
2023-04-14 14:23:29.432 Dean:    eventually
2023-04-14 14:23:25.351 Dean:    
2023-04-14 14:23:20.622 Dean:    If I migrate away from Windows functionality in APIs and Graphics then it is a step toward multi platform compatibility
2023-04-14 14:22:37.751 Dean:    
2023-04-14 14:22:26.134 Dean:    My aim is to create template code for a VB6 Pz widget that I can use to re-create the other widgets
2023-04-14 14:21:38.598 Dean:    looking now into how to incorporate a separate transparent form to support the about image transparently
2023-04-14 14:21:08.014 Dean:    On the VB6 pz widget I have added an about and a full help is square form that standard VB6 can cater for
2023-04-14 14:20:26.345 Dean:    
2023-04-14 14:20:16.791 Dean:    I fell a bit ill myself
2023-04-14 14:20:05.765 Dean:    are you alive?
2023-04-14 11:48:09.023 Dean:    getting over this illness
2023-04-14 11:47:55.535 Dean:    Slept in until mid-day again
2023-04-14 11:47:45.096 Dean:    Good day!
2023-04-13 22:31:39.783 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-04-13 16:08:04.970 Dean:    just as I did for the Xwidget versions
2023-04-13 16:07:53.884 Dean:    When I have hacked a prefs for the widget I will probably re-use it
2023-04-13 16:07:27.930 Dean:    so, it is just a thought
2023-04-13 16:07:17.991 Dean:    a big task I think
2023-04-13 16:07:10.156 Dean:    so that I could read a kon file and extract all the prefs and create a similar prefs for VB6
2023-04-13 16:06:13.074 Dean:    I'm thinking again of creating a KON reader to create a prefs dynamically
2023-04-13 15:49:16.078 Dean:    but progress
2023-04-13 15:49:09.653 Dean:    not working of course
2023-04-13 15:49:01.994 Dean:    I have managed to add a bare-bone preference form to the pz Cairo gauge
2023-04-13 14:35:49.384 Dean:    <><>pzEarthmenu001.png
2023-04-13 14:35:46.280 Dean:    <><>desktop0002.png
2023-04-13 14:32:32.531 Dean:    then I will attempt to rotate the earth
2023-04-13 14:32:16.030 Dean:    I'll get the menus working next
2023-04-13 14:31:57.600 Dean:    I am just integrating the Cairo graphics and the usual VB6 stuff in order to create a template for a Pz widget
2023-04-13 14:31:13.736 Dean:    using Cairo as the basis for the graphics (supposedly as did the original YWE)
2023-04-13 14:30:30.700 Dean:    )
2023-04-13 14:30:29.044 Dean:    it is a pz gauge withe earth in the middle (stationary) but with right click menu added (mostly non-functional
2023-04-13 14:29:45.333 Dean:    then it ought to be possible to run that .exe if it is placed somewere with the resources folder alongside
2023-04-13 14:29:05.776 Dean:    if you managed to click those vbs files and register the vbrichclient DLLs
2023-04-13 14:28:34.585 Dean:    <><>Panzer Earth Gauge.zip
2023-04-13 11:26:27.229 Dean:    Top o' the morning to you!
2023-04-12 22:08:35.196 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-04-12 22:08:30.279 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2023-04-12 16:03:04.912 Dean:    and windy
2023-04-12 16:03:00.698 Dean:    but sunny!
2023-04-12 16:02:56.766 Dean:    cOlder here
2023-04-12 14:57:22.926 Dean:    doesn't resolve the GPU issue though for the dock
2023-04-12 14:56:59.976 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:56:57.055 Dean:    then I could become used to the technology
2023-04-12 14:56:46.935 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:56:30.152 Dean:    perhaps a clock as it would be independent of system API usage
2023-04-12 14:56:00.379 Dean:    What I might do is to create a widget, like the Panzer CPU widget
2023-04-12 14:55:32.625 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:55:31.036 Dean:    so there is some sense in it
2023-04-12 14:55:19.424 Dean:    but it would make the graphics portable to other platforms
2023-04-12 14:54:52.972 Dean:    so a migration to cairo for the dock would be of no use in this respect
2023-04-12 14:54:33.766 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:54:18.032 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:54:16.192 Dean:    and Cairo is not GPU accelerated
2023-04-12 14:54:06.254 Dean:    The issue here is that I want to progress to GPU acceleration instead of CPU
2023-04-12 14:53:36.269 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:53:34.676 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:53:32.489 Dean:    it uses Cairo via vbRichClient 
2023-04-12 14:52:51.910 Dean:    the steampunkEarth is the only functioning example in my hand
2023-04-12 14:52:21.287 Dean:    openGL is a possibility but I can find no VB6 examples
2023-04-12 14:52:04.763 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:52:01.270 Dean:    NOT feel confident
2023-04-12 14:51:54.644 Dean:    IT will take a LOT of experimentation and I do 
2023-04-12 14:51:33.522 Dean:    I have a DirectX 2D dock example but it generates output to a black background and I can find no examples of a VB6 implementation on a transparent window
2023-04-12 14:50:27.475 Dean:    it seems that it is quite difficult to place directX 2D or 3D elements on a transparent window allowing the desktop to be visible
2023-04-12 14:49:22.566 Dean:    but richer and easier to use than straight GDI
2023-04-12 14:49:05.119 Dean:    slower than GDI, or its replacements
2023-04-12 14:48:46.824 Dean:    the current dock is GDI+
2023-04-12 14:48:38.195 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:48:35.854 Dean:    I am looking for the next technology for the dock
2023-04-12 14:48:20.765 Dean:    
2023-04-12 14:47:56.837 Dean:    click on steampunkearth.exe
2023-04-12 14:47:47.234 Dean:    when done
2023-04-12 14:47:44.445 Dean:    run each
2023-04-12 14:47:38.212 Dean:    from a very trusted source
2023-04-12 14:47:25.337 Dean:    they register DLLs
2023-04-12 14:47:18.799 Dean:    in the folder are 2 x .vbs files
2023-04-12 14:47:00.681 Dean:    place into a folder
2023-04-12 14:46:53.586 Dean:    unzip
2023-04-12 14:46:47.960 Dean:    <><>SteamPunkEarth.zip
2023-04-12 12:20:19.868 Dean:    Menus altered to remove the run elevated menu option, not possible with Explorer Windows as UAC prevents it
2023-04-12 12:20:04.968 Dean:    
2023-04-12 12:19:11.798 Dean:    that was much quicker than expected
2023-04-12 12:19:00.838 Dean:    you can now close an explorer window identified using the path
2023-04-12 12:18:29.767 Dean:    rubbish old explorer as always
2023-04-12 12:18:18.915 Dean:    you cannot force a new instance
2023-04-12 12:18:07.004 Dean:    opening up the same link always opens the same folder window
2023-04-12 12:17:50.358 Dean:    managed to modify the menus and adapt them for opening and closing Explorer windows, they act differently to other windows, when you have a window to a folder open already
2023-04-12 12:17:04.915 Dean:    righto
2023-04-12 08:44:11.338 Dean:    
2023-04-12 08:44:09.219 Dean:    and then using that to kill the process
2023-04-12 08:43:56.564 Dean:    That requires identifying and extracting the processID from each explorer instance
2023-04-12 08:42:09.280 Dean:    SD, the cogs are working above explorer to indicate an open window, now need to modify the menu and add a function to close an already existing and matching explorer instance
2023-04-12 08:41:08.464 Dean:    
2023-04-12 08:40:38.993 Dean:    looks good
2023-04-12 08:40:35.865 Dean:    [quote] That's my latest on the Dell. [/quote] 
2023-04-12 08:39:58.304 Dean:    Morning!
2023-04-11 18:53:57.640 Dean:    I quite understand
2023-04-11 18:53:52.472 Dean:    [quote] Can't find time to fix the Dell! [/quote] 
2023-04-11 13:14:38.804 Dean:    What happens if you are ill?
2023-04-11 13:14:17.809 Dean:    or the pension provider?
2023-04-11 13:14:08.224 Dean:    Dutch law?
2023-04-11 13:11:08.682 Dean:    they can't be posted direct to a solicitor in Holland?
2023-04-11 13:10:28.287 Dean:    very frustrating
2023-04-11 13:10:23.644 Dean:    [quote] Totally idiotic. [/quote] 
2023-04-11 11:00:47.915 Dean:    beautiful here
2023-04-11 11:00:43.977 Dean:    
2023-04-11 11:00:24.248 Dean:     Windspeed is 13 knots, force 4, direction W
2023-04-11 11:00:24.248 Dean:     Partly cloudy at 3900 ft.
2023-04-11 11:00:24.248 Dean:     Humidity: 58 % 
2023-04-11 11:00:24.248 Dean:     Temperature: 11.00 C

2023-04-11 11:00:24.248 Dean:     Tue Apr 11 2023 09:50:00 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time) 
2023-04-11 11:00:21.268 Dean:    
2023-04-11 11:00:07.121 Dean:    Any news regarding family? All good I hope.
2023-04-11 10:51:30.391 Dean:    but my inital logic and code does the job, just not yet optimised
2023-04-11 10:50:49.986 Dean:    it is much easier on the CPU that way
2023-04-11 10:50:37.743 Dean:    I need to store the enumerated exp. processes and then loop through the icons
2023-04-11 10:50:10.733 Dean:    I need to tune the process though to minimise CPU, at the moment it is looping through all processes and each time enumerating explorer windows of which there might be three or four
2023-04-11 10:49:22.158 Dean:    SD now places cogs above all instances of explorer windows, identifying them correctly
2023-04-11 10:48:58.750 Dean:    
2023-04-11 10:48:40.095 Dean:    feeling a lot better though
2023-04-11 10:48:30.348 Dean:    strange dreams born of sickness!
2023-04-11 10:48:14.110 Dean:    all well?
2023-04-11 10:48:09.318 Dean:    Morning!
2023-04-10 22:49:41.138 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2023-04-10 17:56:58.454 Dean:    understood
2023-04-10 15:38:54.582 Dean:    I am thinking things through these days rather than just diving in.
2023-04-10 15:38:34.955 Dean:    good progress
2023-04-10 15:38:28.574 Dean:    I've just added the code and structures, timers &c to underpin that and it does what it is mean to do
2023-04-10 15:38:02.041 Dean:    that is the next task
2023-04-10 15:37:50.306 Dean:    if they match, I add a cog to show it is running
2023-04-10 15:37:36.636 Dean:    I now need to enumerate all explorer windows running on the system and compare the icon's folder with those running,
2023-04-10 15:36:47.986 Dean:    on SD I have added a snapshot of explorer processes initiated by the dock and they are stored in a structure that can be quickly tested
2023-04-10 15:35:55.449 Dean:    
2023-04-10 15:02:14.288 Dean:    on which commands?
2023-04-10 14:36:15.350 Dean:    That is what I will be using if I provide and "add browser icon" option to the SD menu
2023-04-10 14:28:19.263 Dean:    as that path could change
2023-04-10 14:27:54.367 Dean:    start msedge should work without the path
2023-04-10 14:27:37.187 Dean:    I posted it on the Rocketdock forum when it existed
2023-04-10 14:27:19.889 Dean:    I have used that in the past when Edge came out
2023-04-10 14:26:57.306 Dean:    try "start microsoft-edge:" or "start msedge" - the latter works
2023-04-10 14:23:11.881 Dean:    whether that works now...
2023-04-10 14:22:37.540 Dean:    %windir%\explorer.exe shell:Appsfolder\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MicrosoftEdge
2023-04-10 14:22:33.342 Dean:    without knowing the path
2023-04-10 14:22:28.463 Dean:    alternative
2023-04-10 14:19:30.250 Dean:    I was just mucking about to see if it baulked at the x86 location
2023-04-10 14:19:05.370 Dean:    and not program files(x86) as I have it
2023-04-10 14:18:49.840 Dean:    most users will have it under program files
2023-04-10 14:18:39.639 Dean:    
2023-04-10 14:18:38.256 Dean:    might be worth checking the path but it does not help you
2023-04-10 14:18:21.854 Dean:    but windows still somehow knows where msedge actually is... so it works as if it is in the path still
2023-04-10 14:17:39.087 Dean:    IE
2023-04-10 14:17:06.290 Dean:    where the Windows ie binaries used to reside
2023-04-10 14:16:50.244 Dean:    to windows\system32
2023-04-10 14:16:40.399 Dean:    so i tis no longer found automatically in the path
2023-04-10 14:16:26.041 Dean:    and sits under the program files folder
2023-04-10 14:16:13.456 Dean:    it is an application now
2023-04-10 14:16:03.725 Dean:    or wherever you find msedge.exe
2023-04-10 14:15:50.191 Dean:    you'll just have to utilise C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe
2023-04-10 14:12:40.984 Dean:    Hmmm
2023-04-10 12:46:26.913 Dean:    but that seems to have gone away
2023-04-10 12:46:19.092 Dean:    there was an issue with early versions
2023-04-10 12:46:09.480 Dean:    with msedge as the command
2023-04-10 12:45:56.925 Dean:    nope, it seems to run fine from the command line
2023-04-10 12:44:32.567 Dean:    will test
2023-04-10 12:44:28.007 Dean:    I cannot fully recall
2023-04-10 12:44:20.912 Dean:    but I retain some information about a problem doing that
2023-04-10 12:43:57.917 Dean:    it shoudl be as simple as running msedge
2023-04-10 12:43:06.459 Dean:    I used to know how but I have forgotten
2023-04-10 12:42:55.130 Dean:    edge is tricky
2023-04-10 10:53:54.843 Dean:    time flies does it not?
2023-04-10 10:53:43.012 Dean:    
2023-04-10 10:53:40.219 Dean:    twenty years ago!
2023-04-10 10:53:32.820 Dean:    loved Quarry Bank when I last visited there
2023-04-10 10:52:02.776 Dean:    \
2023-04-10 10:51:50.067 Dean:    but the symptoms were very similar
2023-04-10 10:51:39.514 Dean:    didn't take a test
2023-04-10 10:51:29.733 Dean:    still sleeping in to recover from what might have been another bout of covid
2023-04-10 10:51:06.783 Dean:    just
2023-04-10 10:51:04.438 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-04-10 10:51:00.267 Dean:    Hello Harry!
2023-04-09 23:33:18.011 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2023-04-09 16:46:43.059 Dean:    Easter egg hunting with the kiddies in the garden
2023-04-09 13:16:56.489 Dean:    just spent time in the garden
2023-04-09 13:16:44.269 Dean:    
2023-04-09 13:16:43.332 Dean:    so I am making the cog appear for those too
2023-04-09 13:16:31.269 Dean:    I have some code that should allow me to enumerate through open explorer instances
2023-04-09 13:16:11.172 Dean:    so when you click on a folder link the cog does not appear on top
2023-04-09 13:15:55.965 Dean:    The dock displays running processes but it does not show open folder windows
2023-04-09 11:52:52.118 Dean:    powering through remaining issues
2023-04-09 11:50:58.097 Dean:    
2023-04-09 11:50:56.241 Dean:    coding whilst in bed though
2023-04-09 11:50:46.209 Dean:    cough is reducing
2023-04-09 11:49:12.218 Dean:    just awoke
2023-04-09 11:49:09.246 Dean:    spent the morning in bed sleeping
2023-04-08 11:17:51.141 Dean:    have fun!
2023-04-08 11:17:46.615 Dean:    [quote] Going to daughter's for a couple of days - expect to be back Sunday evening or Monday midday. [/quote] 
2023-04-08 11:17:40.284 Dean:    [quote] Good Morning! [/quote] 
2023-04-08 11:01:18.872 Dean:    Good day!
2023-04-07 22:59:37.853 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2023-04-07 22:59:34.836 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2023-04-07 14:48:40.328 Dean:    to show the virtual keyboard press Ctl+windows key + O
2023-04-07 14:48:00.474 Dean:    Can be pressed accidentally
2023-04-07 14:47:05.526 Dean:    There may be an EN or US in a box by the systray
2023-04-07 14:37:23.239 Dean:    gone to my chest
2023-04-07 14:37:18.805 Dean:    still rather unwell here
2023-04-07 14:35:25.224 Dean:    the language selection - check that
2023-04-07 14:35:13.150 Dean:    on the taskbar
2023-04-06 22:09:11.038 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2023-04-06 21:50:34.395 Dean:    but it places apps off screen as though it is perfectly normal
2023-04-06 21:50:14.353 Dean:    it knows there i sonly one
2023-04-06 21:50:06.890 Dean:    I even opened the display properties, told it to identify monitors
2023-04-06 21:49:40.097 Dean:    agreed
2023-04-06 21:47:50.800 Dean:    badly thought out o/s
2023-04-06 21:47:41.160 Dean:    
2023-04-06 21:47:32.263 Dean:    with no option to bring it back on screen and Widnows (sic) allows this!
2023-04-06 21:47:09.187 Dean:    and when I maximise the browser it maximises off screen
2023-04-06 21:46:49.049 Dean:    I brought the laptop downstairs having disconnected the screen
2023-04-06 21:46:29.703 Dean:    palemoon was maximised to a remote screen on the lappie
2023-04-06 21:46:07.038 Dean:    
2023-04-06 21:45:49.803 Dean:    bloody windows is being a pain
2023-04-06 21:07:25.663 Dean:    not so tired an wobb;y though
2023-04-06 21:07:12.318 Dean:    sneezing a lot
2023-04-06 21:07:05.896 Dean:    feeling a bit poorly at the mo'
2023-04-06 21:06:45.152 Dean:    
2023-04-06 17:47:34.476 Dean:    so that after an addition/deletion the correct icon retains the reduced opacity
2023-04-06 17:46:59.608 Dean:    made some fixes to SD to cater for deleting and adding icons where other disabled icons exist
2023-04-06 17:45:57.989 Dean:    and if I get on with it, it might be a useful route for the future
2023-04-06 17:45:41.580 Dean:    the C++ with a GUI builder will be particularly useful
2023-04-06 17:45:23.535 Dean:    to see what I was missing
2023-04-06 17:45:14.567 Dean:    just want to be familiar with their IDEs
2023-04-06 17:45:01.283 Dean:    I don't want later versions as there are dependencies I do not have nor want
2023-04-06 17:44:36.069 Dean:    as you know they are equivalents to VB6 with GUI builders built-in
2023-04-06 17:44:02.967 Dean:    Installed Borland Delphi from 2003 and Borland C++ builder from the same time
2023-04-06 17:42:59.608 Dean:    testing
2023-04-06 11:53:06.261 Dean:    Thankyou
2023-04-06 11:42:12.175 Dean:    Good day to you!
2023-04-05 22:37:13.336 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2023-04-05 22:24:50.553 Dean:    sounds good
2023-04-05 22:24:46.933 Dean:    [quote] I've got the new Execute Programs widget working but it needs a polish. [/quote] 
2023-04-05 22:09:28.663 Dean:    feeling a bit poorly still
2023-04-05 22:09:20.469 Dean:    (my brain is not working well)
2023-04-05 22:09:08.994 Dean:    more difficult than I expected
2023-04-05 22:07:45.141 Dean:    SD 
2023-04-05 22:07:34.579 Dean:    I fixed some regressions re: DS's background theme placement and width
2023-04-05 22:07:07.519 Dean:    
2023-04-05 14:08:26.395 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTsCx0E7YkA
2023-04-05 13:48:10.767 Dean:    and see how it goes
2023-04-05 13:48:01.176 Dean:    just drop them under those
2023-04-05 13:47:52.405 Dean:    Your suggestion is as good as others
2023-04-05 13:47:33.615 Dean:    That's why they didn't I presume
2023-04-05 13:47:17.033 Dean:    [quote] Not entirely clear how you would name the five rows! [/quote] 
2023-04-05 13:38:09.101 Dean:    what does Mac o/s do, does it have an equally useful menu?
2023-04-05 13:37:27.076 Dean:    that used on Linux is only marginally more sensible
2023-04-05 13:37:04.034 Dean:    I think your selection is as good as any
2023-04-05 13:35:20.432 Dean:    just dumps it all on one page
2023-04-05 13:35:10.431 Dean:    The control panel is not heirarchical
2023-04-05 13:33:02.553 Dean:    <><>admin0001.png
2023-04-05 13:30:05.389 Dean:    if you open a Win7 start menu you recieve an administrative start menu 
2023-04-05 13:06:10.930 Dean:    
2023-04-05 13:06:09.403 Dean:    righto
2023-04-05 12:43:10.931 Dean:    ?
2023-04-05 12:43:08.144 Dean:    any specific aim
2023-04-05 10:33:46.426 Dean:    headaches, muscle ache, crusty chest and very tired
2023-04-05 10:24:15.450 Dean:    slept for two days
2023-04-05 10:24:06.578 Dean:    had a dose of mild fluu
2023-04-03 22:25:05.036 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2023-04-03 19:26:37.186 Dean:    no obvious fix
2023-04-03 19:26:18.084 Dean:    so that bug is part of Win 7
2023-04-03 19:26:08.897 Dean:    I rebooted yesterday
2023-04-03 19:25:59.011 Dean:    a little later
2023-04-03 19:25:48.128 Dean:    I'll see if I can get that sorted via command line
2023-04-03 19:25:29.018 Dean:    the command to synch the time probably needs the service to be running
2023-04-03 19:25:08.497 Dean:    so I see the time probs
2023-04-03 19:24:35.243 Dean:    the time synch service was not started
2023-04-03 19:24:26.011 Dean:    done
2023-04-03 19:24:38.297 Dean:    will issue the synch via the GUI
2023-04-03 19:23:33.468 Dean:    test 2 back at you
2023-04-03 19:23:15.503 Dean:    issued the command earlier and then reissued it
2023-04-03 19:22:41.733 Dean:    test
2023-04-03 19:22:37.847 Dean:    I have issued the time synch command
2023-04-03 19:22:15.064 Dean:    let me try again
2023-04-03 19:22:11.157 Dean:    hmmmm
2023-04-03 19:21:54.361 Dean:    yes
2023-04-03 19:21:43.211 Dean:    all good?
2023-04-03 19:21:22.700 Dean:    I'll think about that
2023-04-03 19:21:16.305 Dean:    at the moment I just have a lamp
2023-04-03 19:21:06.387 Dean:    perhaps we need to add an optional sound when a text update is made
2023-04-03 19:20:39.873 Dean:    I am here
2023-04-03 19:20:37.513 Dean:    hello
2023-04-03 18:17:21.540 Dean:    let's chat to see
2023-04-03 18:17:14.787 Dean:    corrected?
2023-04-03 18:17:09.873 Dean:    How's that?
2023-04-03 16:23:35.155 Dean:    it is now the correct size to match the icon (it was previously slightly smaller) and it is 50% more transparent so you can't even see the 'shadow' of the background
2023-04-03 16:22:34.679 Dean:    I have improved it
2023-04-03 16:22:29.624 Dean:    previously I had a 1% transparent background behind the icon that would capture the click
2023-04-03 16:21:59.303 Dean:    and so the click goes straight through
2023-04-03 16:21:46.195 Dean:    or rather the underlying form is also transparent
2023-04-03 16:21:25.681 Dean:    if you have an icon with a lot of transparent space, a click in the icon area goes straight through as there is no underlying form
2023-04-03 16:20:54.186 Dean:    SD - fixed the occasional failure to handle clickthroughs on transparent areas of the icons
2023-04-03 16:08:03.275 Dean:    
2023-04-03 16:08:01.067 Dean:    such a pain
2023-04-03 13:37:03.406 Dean:    
2023-04-03 09:55:56.081 Dean:    <><>menus001.png
2023-04-03 09:53:59.127 Dean:    same with SD
2023-04-03 09:53:51.657 Dean:    that is a problme
2023-04-03 09:53:45.892 Dean:    [quote] The menus are getting far too long and some restructuring into menus and sub-menus would be needed. [/quote] 
2023-04-02 22:37:48.946 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2023-04-02 20:50:41.615 Dean:    cold tonight
2023-04-02 20:09:53.319 Dean:    
2023-04-02 20:09:50.319 Dean:    then loop through the array
2023-04-02 20:09:40.953 Dean:    I split a string into an array
2023-04-02 20:09:27.314 Dean:    vb6 has the split command but not quite as useful
2023-04-02 20:09:05.460 Dean:    
2023-04-02 20:08:52.493 Dean:    I have implemented that a split of suffix types and loop through each and searching for each suffix
2023-04-02 20:08:05.123 Dean:    any such name found in system32
2023-04-02 20:07:47.657 Dean:    and execute
2023-04-02 20:07:03.506 Dean:    and it will search current path then if not found as an executable
2023-04-02 20:06:37.617 Dean:    it exists in windows\system32
2023-04-02 20:06:21.153 Dean:    for example: control
2023-04-02 20:06:14.483 Dean:    a few changes to SD, sometimes people just type in admin commands using the filename with no suffix
2023-04-02 20:05:47.068 Dean:    
2023-04-02 18:32:17.393 Dean:    all provided by default in Windows

2023-03-27 18:16:12.689 Dean:    so, good idea to have a couple of cooling pads just in case
2023-03-27 18:15:49.023 Dean:    Dell uses paste for the main CPU but heat exchanging pads for other chips within the pipe route
2023-03-27 18:14:59.973 Dean:    undoing the screws and removing the copper pipes is not a difficult task
2023-03-27 18:14:27.557 Dean:

2023-03-27 18:12:51.442 Dean:    ah yes, a typical laptop fan
2023-03-27 18:11:14.209 Dean:    and I keep the OHM gauge on screen at the top  so my dashboard is clear and any problems revealed
2023-03-27 18:10:35.134 Dean:    this CPU is known to run hot
2023-03-27 18:10:16.169 Dean:    
2023-03-27 18:09:58.434 Dean:    I do keep the radiator free of dust every two months 
2023-03-27 18:08:52.788 Dean:    is 45-57C
2023-03-27 18:08:40.490 Dean:    My e6410 that needs new paste, runs quite hot in general by dint of its design
2023-03-27 18:07:17.331 Dean:    can you send a photo of the heatsink and attachements if that is possible?
2023-03-27 18:06:47.986 Dean:    
2023-03-27 18:06:46.328 Dean:    heat sinks blocked is a real problem
2023-03-27 18:06:24.783 Dean:    and you cannot be sure of the quality of paste they used originally
2023-03-27 18:06:02.338 Dean:    it may well dry the cpu paste more quickly
2023-03-27 18:05:50.029 Dean:    As the machine probably generally runs hot due to the design
2023-03-27 09:54:12.011 Dean:    also usable on any CPU in the future
2023-03-27 09:53:53.127 Dean:    water coooled, closed circuit, with external fans
2023-03-27 09:53:39.372 Dean:    there are pads that you apply to the CPU that have pipes that can fit externally though holes cut in the case
2023-03-27 09:53:03.154 Dean:    still though, might be worth researching to see if anyone else has done something different
2023-03-27 09:49:13.812 Dean:    yes
2023-03-27 09:49:11.149 Dean:    Hmmm
2023-03-27 09:39:28.940 Dean:    
2023-03-27 09:39:10.584 Dean:    h
2023-03-27 09:39:07.051 Dean:    whic in your case would be a pain
2023-03-27 09:38:57.124 Dean:    the mobo. has to be removed though
2023-03-27 09:38:46.250 Dean:    it secures under the mobo. providing screw-tightening to make a good connection to the cpu
2023-03-27 09:38:05.558 Dean:    the kit attaches to the existing heat sink
2023-03-27 09:37:47.114 Dean:    it was wobbly and poor contact made with the CPU
2023-03-27 09:37:29.940 Dean:    it affixed poorly through four holes using an interference fit
2023-03-27 09:36:58.874 Dean:    wide
2023-03-27 09:36:56.434 Dean:     and 5 x 3"
2023-03-27 09:36:42.605 Dean:    the cooler for my 4ghz i7 gen 6 CPU is about 6" tall
2023-03-27 09:35:45.257 Dean:    I am just buying a mounting bracket for the motherboard that I am putting in the G5 that will mount a large cooler
2023-03-27 09:35:04.611 Dean:    someone may well have done it before you
2023-03-27 09:34:42.547 Dean:    there might be a better slimline cooler that you can fit for not much money
2023-03-27 09:34:18.277 Dean:    it should state in the specs the CPU connection type LGA 1366 &c
2023-03-27 09:33:56.170 Dean:    If you look at the fan and mountings on the mobo. you can identify the connection type
2023-03-27 09:32:26.206 Dean:    It could be that the system just does run hot and as a result is more unreliable when pushed or when the ambient temps are too high
2023-03-27 09:23:02.931 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-03-26 21:27:14.838 Dean:    very cheap, very good
2023-03-26 21:27:07.584 Dean:    and use arctic silver paste
2023-03-26 21:26:57.992 Dean:    remove the old paste on the cpu
2023-03-26 21:26:49.070 Dean:    remove the fan, clear the radiator of dust
2023-03-26 21:26:29.209 Dean:    I think it would be wise to buy some special 'arctic' cpu paste
2023-03-26 21:25:55.827 Dean:    especially the max readings
2023-03-26 21:25:49.061 Dean:    yours look over temperature
2023-03-26 21:25:35.845 Dean:    my max is 45-63
2023-03-26 21:24:31.955 Dean:    other cores 32-40
2023-03-26 21:24:18.945 Dean:    45C maximum
2023-03-26 21:24:06.566 Dean:    my temps here when playing a game that requires a lot of resources
2023-03-26 19:06:21.770 Dean:    if you run OHM  what are the CPU temps?
2023-03-26 19:05:55.913 Dean:    might need to extract the cooler from the PSU and apply new CPU paste
2023-03-26 19:05:33.478 Dean:    I find the lack of space and cooling on those systems has a negative impact on the mobo
2023-03-26 19:02:28.732 Dean:    when things fail, mobo and PSU-wise might be difficult to solve
2023-03-26 19:01:49.412 Dean:    but I've not yet felt the need
2023-03-26 19:01:40.600 Dean:    touch screen is a bonus
2023-03-26 19:01:26.951 Dean:    too difficult to upgrade and work upon
2023-03-26 19:01:11.604 Dean:    The cooking PCs (all built-in) ready for the kitchen, are not my chosen design types
2023-03-26 18:13:46.538 Dean:    and my brain
2023-03-26 18:13:37.670 Dean:    I meant my watch
2023-03-26 17:25:11.050 Dean:    I seem to have lost an hour
2023-03-26 17:25:04.697 Dean:    all good?
2023-03-26 11:48:44.950 Dean:     Windspeed is 15 knots, force 4, direction NNE
2023-03-26 11:48:44.950 Dean:     Mostly cloudy at 2500 ft.
2023-03-26 11:48:44.950 Dean:     Humidity: 66 %

2023-03-26 11:48:31.277 Dean:    Good day!
2023-03-26 11:48:27.666 Dean:    Hello!
2023-03-25 23:34:04.589 Dean:    started 4 mins ago
2023-03-25 23:33:50.168 Dean:    virtualtelescope.eu
2023-03-25 23:33:32.510 Dean:    in bed
2023-03-25 23:33:28.867 Dean:    the online observation
2023-03-25 23:33:14.506 Dean:    wathcing the near-earth asteroid telecast
2023-03-25 23:31:49.265 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-03-25 23:31:46.104 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2023-03-25 23:29:42.645 Dean:    
2023-03-25 23:29:36.570 Dean:    but I wouldn't change it much more than that
2023-03-25 23:29:27.112 Dean:    So, to sum up, I would upgrade it to make the current system more usable and flexible
2023-03-25 23:28:59.344 Dean:    
2023-03-25 23:28:49.434 Dean:    then you'll have a top notch DOS gaming system
2023-03-25 23:28:26.963 Dean:    I have one of those if you need it
2023-03-25 23:28:17.326 Dean:    and perhaps a soundblaster card
2023-03-25 23:28:03.487 Dean:    and a more recent ethernet board
2023-03-25 23:27:33.211 Dean:    e
2023-03-25 23:27:31.424 Dean:    and fit quiter fans
2023-03-25 23:27:24.454 Dean:    uprate the PSU perhaps
2023-03-25 23:27:09.286 Dean:    or service it, upgrade it giving it modern storage SD card reader, boot from SD or fast HD using an IDE to SATA adapter
2023-03-25 23:25:53.697 Dean:    I would keep that as a retro gaming PC for DOS games
2023-03-25 23:25:36.184 Dean:    has all you need 
2023-03-25 23:25:26.767 Dean:    and that sort of PC, floppy, CD, VGA, ethernet, TV board, serial and parallel
2023-03-25 23:23:52.026 Dean:    The retro PC community is growing
2023-03-25 23:23:14.527 Dean:    Pentium P133
2023-03-25 23:22:37.868 Dean:    what is the CPU?
2023-03-25 23:22:25.117 Dean:    probably better put to use a retro computer
2023-03-25 23:22:04.248 Dean:    Well, that would be a very good target for ReactOS
2023-03-25 19:16:12.979 Dean:    a bit at least
2023-03-25 19:16:07.886 Dean:    fixing FCW for high res screen operation
2023-03-25 15:51:42.603 Dean:    send a photo
2023-03-25 15:47:08.738 Dean:    I just bought it for 40GBP 20 months old
2023-03-25 15:46:31.575 Dean:    I let someone else buy it new
2023-03-25 15:46:23.276 Dean:    I didn't buy it!
2023-03-25 15:46:15.622 Dean:    the current black case on my fast desktop was 200gbp
2023-03-25 15:45:45.817 Dean:    there is a small mini ATX case with the same Apple design, a quarter of the size and a quarter of the quality for 125 gbp
2023-03-25 15:44:54.849 Dean:    an equivalent quality case would cost 400gbp+ just for the case!
2023-03-25 15:44:23.914 Dean:    you can buy a G5 from 60-100gbp
2023-03-25 15:44:11.576 Dean:    
2023-03-25 15:44:08.326 Dean:    but they are two a penny at the moment
2023-03-25 15:44:00.577 Dean:    I may have destroyed a G5 mobo and CPUs
2023-03-25 15:43:42.155 Dean:    
2023-03-25 15:43:37.676 Dean:    and it was just sitting there... filthy and staring at me
2023-03-25 15:43:18.496 Dean:    so, it would almost never be used except as a object of interest
2023-03-25 15:42:47.846 Dean:    when it runs is consumes loads of power
2023-03-25 15:42:30.382 Dean:    3-4hrs of work due to the complexity of the case and construction
2023-03-25 15:42:09.089 Dean:    in addition it needed a service, PSU cleaned out and tested, coolers removed and new paste on the CPUs
2023-03-25 15:41:37.571 Dean:    The only reason I adapted the G5 is that the o/s was quite out of date and inly usable as a historical piece
2023-03-25 15:40:58.206 Dean:    which PC?
2023-03-25 15:20:12.899 Dean:    What do you think of the result?
2023-03-25 15:14:38.242 Dean:    and I will replace it with my newer mobo later
2023-03-25 12:48:40.247 Dean:    just proves the point
2023-03-25 12:48:32.462 Dean:    the mobo is a good one but now second rate
2023-03-25 12:48:20.309 Dean:    The G5 is now a working PC

2023-03-25 11:21:24.132 Dean:    100 yards across
2023-03-25 11:21:07.760 Dean:    it can be seen with binoculars if you have a clear sky (you won't)
2023-03-25 11:20:49.204 Dean:    There is an asteroid passing between the earth and moon today
2023-03-25 11:20:31.876 Dean:    I wonder if they knew and looked out of the window
2023-03-25 10:39:03.266 Dean:    Morning!
2023-03-24 23:04:01.896 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire

2023-03-23 19:24:08.654 Dean:    Not ggod, take care
2023-03-23 16:18:50.042 Dean:    just dull
2023-03-23 16:18:47.505 Dean:    no rain here
2023-03-23 15:13:17.752 Dean:    more cutting to do
2023-03-23 15:12:01.900 Dean:    some progress

2023-03-23 13:54:46.291 Dean:    there is some sense in a simple menu option that calls the relevant files directly
2023-03-23 13:54:26.229 Dean:    I already those on the dock under add icons - administrative icons but they add icons to the dock
2023-03-23 13:53:46.759 Dean:    Your cpanel widget is one of my residents now
2023-03-23 13:46:38.757 Dean:    I'll send you the updates shortly shorty
2023-03-23 13:46:26.825 Dean:    I am just bashing the rest of my old XWidgets into shape with regard to the functioning of the prefs window
2023-03-23 13:45:53.263 Dean:    
2023-03-23 13:45:51.747 Dean:    time flies does it not?
2023-03-23 13:45:45.312 Dean:    I created that a couple of decades ago
2023-03-23 13:45:31.113 Dean:    good news
2023-03-23 12:32:12.432 Dean:    <><>wotw.chm
2023-03-23 12:31:25.223 Dean:    I have an old one that you can try
2023-03-23 12:31:18.218 Dean:    I have the tools and I was going to build one soonish
2023-03-23 12:31:03.993 Dean:    not yet
2023-03-23 12:19:38.965 Dean:    opening a browser to view some html can be a bit heavyweight sometimes
2023-03-23 12:19:14.055 Dean:    they maybe old but they are still a good solution for displaying discrete help windows
2023-03-23 12:18:41.464 Dean:    I am going to produce CHM files for the help for SD
2023-03-23 11:43:35.130 Dean:    but not in VB6 without some chicanery
2023-03-23 11:43:21.930 Dean:    I can do it in VB.NET
2023-03-23 11:43:08.223 Dean:    can you add icons to menu options? I am fairly certain you can't in ywe
2023-03-23 11:42:01.711 Dean:    it is very useful
2023-03-23 11:35:35.277 Dean:    How does Mac o/s handle CHM files?
2023-03-23 11:34:56.277 Dean:    so, I will wait a little longer for that to occur
2023-03-23 11:34:43.538 Dean:    
2023-03-23 11:34:40.658 Dean:    but they have to be complete and functional and they must exist of course
2023-03-23 11:34:21.355 Dean:    that would work
2023-03-23 11:34:17.267 Dean:    and testing that on Windows and bundling its .cpl files instead
2023-03-23 11:33:58.016 Dean:    h
2023-03-23 11:33:55.464 Dean:    so, I thougt about waiting for the ReactOS control panel
2023-03-23 11:33:30.605 Dean:    for licensing reasons
2023-03-23 11:33:14.821 Dean:    which is a bit of a no-no
2023-03-23 11:32:58.684 Dean:    so I would have to bundle the old .cpl and .msc files
2023-03-23 11:32:44.062 Dean:    I was going to create my own control panel using steamy icons, only problem then was that the applets on Win10+ are being replaced by big pig-ugly versions,
2023-03-23 11:31:25.837 Dean:    on the exchange folder
2023-03-23 11:31:15.119 Dean:    have a look
2023-03-23 11:31:10.175 Dean:    the widget was copied inside the widget
2023-03-23 10:45:05.902 Dean:    but having that as a widget might do as a replacement
2023-03-23 10:44:50.745 Dean:    in VB
2023-03-23 10:44:46.873 Dean:    I want to recreate a control panel using my steamy icons and have that call the same utils
2023-03-23 10:44:01.509 Dean:    I try to avoid using Win10/11 system anything

2023-03-20 12:02:00.597 Dean:    seems a shame to throw it away
2023-03-20 12:01:51.123 Dean:    600W 
2023-03-20 12:01:46.878 Dean:    but to a standard of 20 years ago
2023-03-20 12:01:38.205 Dean:    it uses standard PC power connectors and probably the same pinouts
2023-03-20 12:01:18.121 Dean:    unsure what to do with such a high quality but huge PSU
2023-03-20 12:00:51.172 Dean:    the PSU was covered in an INCH of dust
2023-03-20 12:00:37.729 Dean:    that is AFTER hoovering
2023-03-20 12:00:28.031 Dean:    <><>336183645_736034334577489_1646193616452381168_n.jpg
2023-03-20 12:00:10.370 Dean:    plenty of space now the massive original PSU has been removed
2023-03-20 11:59:44.460 Dean:    and replaced by laser pre-cut components
2023-03-20 11:59:25.084 Dean:    all the metalwork at the rear will be cut out
2023-03-20 11:58:54.728 Dean:    and the Mobo./PSU
2023-03-20 11:58:45.355 Dean:    trial fitment of the mounting plate to hold the standard PC motherborad

2023-03-20 11:55:59.587 Dean:    That's what I'm putting in, tried and tested, decent mobo and CPU with 32gb RAM,  600w PSU
2023-03-20 11:55:27.517 Dean:    <><>335162314_739415174481971_8405998302767023258_n.jpg

2023-03-20 11:54:41.274 Dean:    even
2023-03-20 11:54:37.907 Dean:    using proprietary screw types evern
2023-03-20 11:54:28.598 Dean:    but over-engineered, not compatible with anything physically
2023-03-20 11:54:02.965 Dean:    very high quality everything
2023-03-20 11:53:52.378 Dean:    that is the crowded and dusty G5 interior
2023-03-20 11:53:32.168 Dean:    <><>335754894_925683661899097_6488854454468814910_n.jpg
2023-03-20 11:53:25.700 Dean:    if it works then I will place a better one in its stead
2023-03-20 11:53:12.057 Dean:    not a modern mobo. just useful for trial installation inside the G5 case
2023-03-20 11:52:49.682 Dean:    the pile of bits that will serve my newest PC
2023-03-20 11:52:36.743 Dean:    <><>326546062_1308172826412793_5623902916365754997_n.jpg

2023-03-20 11:42:59.500 Dean:    just finishing it off

2023-03-19 23:29:13.053 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-03-19 21:56:18.161 Dean:    I use a few of these
2023-03-19 21:56:11.368 Dean:    Yes, very useful
2023-03-19 16:49:56.676 Dean:    been out to see mum
2023-03-19 16:49:47.960 Dean:    Are you doing well?
2023-03-19 12:50:36.550 Dean:    righto
2023-03-19 00:29:01.789 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2023-03-18 20:09:53.894 Dean:    it is always good to see a new widget!
2023-03-18 19:56:56.526 Dean:    It is working well, the resize using a mouse seems a little slow and jerky on my E6410 with a little delay but it all works as per the Xwidget
2023-03-18 19:52:26.140 Dean:    wilco
2023-03-18 11:50:48.917 Dean:    also on the laptop Startup manager is now jumping across the screen again from bottom right to top left!
2023-03-18 11:50:23.086 Dean:    
2023-03-18 11:50:21.568 Dean:    once a week I play!
2023-03-18 11:50:16.207 Dean:    Mediaeval Total War II
2023-03-18 11:50:04.083 Dean:    I cannot live without my game!
2023-03-18 11:49:55.236 Dean:    also, one of my main games does not work on the new monitor regardless of the resolution setting, need to investigate why
2023-03-18 11:49:18.955 Dean:    
2023-03-18 11:49:18.620 Dean:    
2023-03-18 11:49:16.860 Dean:    need to find a bug for that
2023-03-18 11:49:09.816 Dean:    also, the background to a wide screen of icons blanks itself after a certain swidth
2023-03-18 11:48:42.245 Dean:    the dock itself can have an instability between the icon boundaries (as you have discovered) at certain combinations of icon sizes, that needs to be fixed and I have a fix for that
2023-03-18 11:47:51.459 Dean:    I will have to implement that for the other utilities
2023-03-18 11:47:33.376 Dean:    the font grows proportionally
2023-03-18 11:47:25.662 Dean:    the generate dock utility can scale by dragging the corner of the app and increasing the window size,
2023-03-18 11:46:59.140 Dean:    not badly but it affects them
2023-03-18 11:46:43.018 Dean:    without scaling the settings and config utilties for SD look tiny, with scaling they are blurred
2023-03-18 11:46:13.734 Dean:    a few problems.,.
2023-03-18 11:46:07.386 Dean:    
2023-03-18 11:46:06.645 Dean:    I have received my 4K monitor

2023-03-18 10:18:33.971 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-03-17 12:03:01.130 Dean:    I hope to~

2023-03-16 22:45:26.439 Dean:    even when you are just explaining why you want to avoid a fire
2023-03-16 22:45:04.768 Dean:    (she does not like being told what to do)
2023-03-16 22:44:53.351 Dean:    and the look of disbelief on her face
2023-03-16 22:44:44.239 Dean:    I have to explain why you shouldn't do that
2023-03-16 22:44:26.034 Dean:    she pits 18v battery packs for her \garden tools in the drawers with all her stuff, knives , garden wire &c
2023-03-16 22:43:38.505 Dean:    pointless
2023-03-16 22:43:34.213 Dean:    trying to educate a female into the ways of battery maintenance...
2023-03-16 22:43:07.973 Dean:    the others should be saveable
2023-03-16 22:42:58.468 Dean:    3 x 18650s all corroded
2023-03-16 22:42:43.889 Dean:    the battery pack was completely rusted one end
2023-03-16 22:42:30.170 Dean:    to take the rain blown in under the lapboard
2023-03-16 22:42:12.198 Dean:    left it there over the winter
2023-03-16 22:41:59.321 Dean:    Lucy destroyed a 36v battery pack by poking it  into the porch and wedging it between the wood pile and the wooden exterior
2023-03-16 22:41:14.557 Dean:    
2023-03-16 22:25:15.891 Dean:    righto!
2023-03-16 11:12:59.203 Dean:    the xul is very similar  to the kon
2023-03-16 11:12:37.016 Dean:    I did a bit of investigation into file sharing greater than 2gb, they all seem to be sticking at that limit
2023-03-16 11:12:03.599 Dean:    feel free to delete old shared stuff from YWE as you like
2023-03-16 11:11:39.268 Dean:    
2023-03-16 11:11:37.588 Dean:    takes almost as long as the main program
2023-03-16 11:11:27.124 Dean:    that need to have the prefs screens built manually
2023-03-16 11:11:10.766 Dean:    they could potentially be called by xwidgets too
2023-03-16 11:10:32.295 Dean:    so I can create prefs utilities as required by my VB6 programs
2023-03-16 11:09:44.816 Dean:    I wanted to create it VB6
2023-03-16 11:09:35.193 Dean:    I want to create a prefs tool that reads a XML file and is able to generate a prefs program just as per YWE
2023-03-16 11:08:59.560 Dean:    Well, now you have me working on my idea for a prefs tool
2023-03-16 10:49:50.227 Dean:    so I lost interest somewhat
2023-03-16 10:49:41.133 Dean:    I think it may have been the last Xwidget that I created
2023-03-16 10:49:13.485 Dean:    it would make a good candidate for a YWidget
2023-03-16 10:49:01.313 Dean:    I will update the regulator shortly
2023-03-16 10:48:18.525 Dean:    at the moment you have to move the two together
2023-03-16 10:48:07.210 Dean:    so you can open the prefs, move it independently of the main widget and when closed the widgets is back in place
2023-03-16 10:47:05.039 Dean:    at te moment I am just working on separating the main widget and the prefs screen
2023-03-16 10:46:43.030 Dean:    still all good and working
2023-03-16 10:46:37.507 Dean:    not an updated version but the previous
2023-03-16 10:46:24.901 Dean:    and it is in the xwidgets dropbox folder
2023-03-16 10:46:09.387 Dean:    it is called regulator
2023-03-16 10:43:53.024 Dean:    ready for testing on the Ubuntu box
2023-03-16 10:43:41.450 Dean:    that is why they are on screen with the YWE versions
2023-03-16 10:43:31.396 Dean:    I have been fixing the minor issues with the Xwidgets
2023-03-16 10:43:05.498 Dean:    in the slots
2023-03-16 10:43:00.084 Dean:    the hour and min hands move up and down vertically
2023-03-16 10:42:41.606 Dean:    it was a xwidget
2023-03-16 10:42:30.209 Dean:    I probablynever created a YWE version
2023-03-16 10:42:18.677 Dean:    oh
2023-03-16 10:38:59.470 Dean:    we need to clear out the YWE exchange area
2023-03-16 10:38:44.394 Dean:    I know the feeling
2023-03-16 10:38:39.221 Dean:    yes
2023-03-16 10:38:12.317 Dean:    <><>10.png
2023-03-16 10:31:58.206 Dean:    that's clever
2023-03-16 10:14:20.412 Dean:    and because we need a telly in the lounge
2023-03-16 10:13:53.585 Dean:    bought to test my programs  primarily
2023-03-16 10:12:14.548 Dean:    I have become quite used to it
2023-03-16 10:11:36.885 Dean:    Good for the viaually imparied
2023-03-16 10:10:49.896 Dean:    which means that it looks like a traditional monitor only upscaled
2023-03-16 10:10:15.844 Dean:    only 1920 x 1080
2023-03-16 10:10:08.483 Dean:    an interesting experience
2023-03-16 10:09:58.260 Dean:    for the last few months
2023-03-16 10:09:51.108 Dean:    40"
2023-03-16 10:09:05.062 Dean:    I have been using a flat screen telly
2023-03-16 10:08:48.757 Dean:    much cheaper
2023-03-16 10:08:41.655 Dean:    refurbished
2023-03-16 10:08:34.673 Dean:    I bought a 4K monitor for my fast desktop
2023-03-16 10:07:16.829 Dean:    always good
2023-03-16 10:07:13.199 Dean:    [quote] Back from visit to Dracula. A rather nice female Dracula. [/quote] 
2023-03-16 09:55:32.585 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-03-16 09:55:31.355 Dean:    Hello!
2023-03-16 09:55:29.415 Dean:    Hello Harry!
2023-03-15 18:21:09.657 Dean:    quite steamy...
2023-03-15 18:20:54.109 Dean:    or focus the rays onto a small boiler and use that to generate steam to power a turbine
2023-03-15 18:20:27.414 Dean:    you need a complex system of controllable and targetable mirrors  that can catch the sun's rays to point to your solar charger
2023-03-15 18:14:09.826 DeanFastPC:    shop bought
2023-03-15 18:14:05.420 DeanFastPC:    chips and breaded plaice here
2023-03-15 18:13:52.826 DeanFastPC:    it's a good hearty meal
2023-03-15 18:13:16.623 DeanFastPC:    in my experience it does little
2023-03-15 18:13:04.560 DeanFastPC:    did the solar charger help?
2023-03-15 18:12:46.717 DeanFastPC:    [quote] Just been down to run the car engine for 10 minutes to charge the battery. [/quote] 
2023-03-15 16:24:39.450 DeanFastPC:    then cleaning as I go
2023-03-15 16:24:30.240 DeanFastPC:    today I am rubbing down the various frames, filling cracks, sanding and then painting white
2023-03-15 16:24:03.890 DeanFastPC:    
2023-03-15 16:22:50.722 DeanFastPC:    we shall see!
2023-03-15 16:22:32.660 DeanFastPC:    I may also have a second boot drive with mac o/s on it and then have it bootable as a HacIntosh
2023-03-15 16:21:52.793 DeanFastPC:    and the quality of the case will match the quality of the hardware inside
2023-03-15 16:21:29.323 DeanFastPC:    when it is all done mechanically, then I will transfer my best mobo and GPU, PSU into it
2023-03-15 16:20:50.003 DeanFastPC:    and then build that PC without worrying about performance, it just needs to fit and operate, swicthes, fans &c
2023-03-15 16:20:07.204 DeanFastPC:    on the G5, I have a load of older parts that I can fit in just to test
2023-03-15 16:19:47.220 DeanFastPC:    
2023-03-15 15:38:03.378 Dean:    make some routines for sizing, moving &c
2023-03-15 15:37:42.837 Dean:    create instances of that icon class
2023-03-15 15:37:32.015 Dean:    assign it properties left, top, width, height, opacity,
2023-03-15 15:37:23.608 Dean:    create a class of icon
2023-03-15 15:37:15.276 Dean:    thinking about my gpahics issues with GDI+, the best way of doing what I want to do
2023-03-15 10:57:45.024 Dean:    When I rfefer to G3 Mac I meant G5
2023-03-15 10:21:47.015 Dean:    awake for two hours
2023-03-15 10:21:39.523 Dean:    woke up at 3 with upset tummy
2023-03-14 20:25:47.949 Dean:    I have all the bits ready to go
2023-03-14 20:25:37.246 Dean:    but when the new metal work is added it will allow full size PC motherboards and cards and a standard PSU
2023-03-14 20:24:54.801 Dean:    with a grinder/hacksaw
2023-03-14 20:24:44.620 Dean:    I'll still have to cut the case
2023-03-14 20:24:31.911 Dean:    I bought the metalwork to convert my old G3Mac to a PC
2023-03-14 17:48:44.697 Dean:    too much to do!
2023-03-14 17:48:40.146 Dean:    my cooking recently has deteriorated
2023-03-14 17:48:27.060 Dean:    shop-bought
2023-03-14 17:48:21.328 Dean:    now cooking lasagne
2023-03-14 17:48:13.826 Dean:    paid some bills!
2023-03-14 17:48:02.319 Dean:    sorted some wood for the next jobs
2023-03-14 17:47:54.100 Dean:    painted, rubbed down wood in preparation, analysed some GDI+ methods from other devs, 2nd wash day complete, cut a template for the window ledge to cover with lead
2023-03-14 17:46:07.899 Dean:    had a good day today
2023-03-14 17:46:02.688 Dean:    
2023-03-14 17:37:51.972 Dean:    had washing on the line, blustery but mildly so
2023-03-14 17:37:33.945 Dean:    some spots of rain
2023-03-14 17:37:25.563 Dean:    only just clouded over
2023-03-14 17:37:21.083 Dean:    Bright and clear all day
2023-03-14 14:01:14.866 Dean:    it might be the next bit of serious learning I have to do
2023-03-14 14:01:01.051 Dean:    but I have not yet done it
2023-03-14 14:00:52.175 Dean:    I know it can be done
2023-03-14 14:00:46.144 Dean:    I think I could possibly handle animations but using vb6 to create image objects that have properties that I can assign values to...
2023-03-14 13:59:59.276 Dean:    I think it is a bit above my paygrade currently
2023-03-14 13:59:39.152 Dean:    creating a graphics library for GDI+...
2023-03-14 13:59:25.639 Dean:    so, a lot of basic stuff to do
2023-03-14 13:59:16.738 Dean:    
2023-03-14 13:59:14.441 Dean:    I have to create some objects that will have properties that I then convert to GDI+ 'things' that I paint to the screen
2023-03-14 13:58:29.367 Dean:    
2023-03-14 13:58:27.737 Dean:    you just write to a screen context and then display the mishmash
2023-03-14 13:58:11.290 Dean:    the trouble is there is no concept of an GDI+ object that has properties
2023-03-14 13:57:47.722 Dean:    that can apply to objects 
2023-03-14 13:57:25.423 Dean:    What I really need to do is to create some basic animation functions
2023-03-14 13:38:34.834 Dean:    
2023-03-14 13:38:31.692 Dean:    the current method will go soon or be replaced by a better method
2023-03-14 13:38:06.062 Dean:    tried adapting the existing animation but that does not work due to the method it uses to size dock entries
2023-03-14 13:37:40.031 Dean:    now working on a separate animation for entering the dock
2023-03-14 13:37:25.882 Dean:    
2023-03-14 13:37:16.751 Dean:    but it also now gives a small visual single the icon has been clicked upon
2023-03-14 13:36:57.230 Dean:    new version has a ting or a click if desired
2023-03-14 13:36:36.335 Dean:    this helps when all mouseDown animations are switched off, or the icon has quickLaunch enabled
2023-03-14 13:36:08.156 Dean:    SD - added a momentary icon full transparency when clicked upon as per RD
2023-03-14 13:35:34.144 Dean:    
2023-03-14 13:35:32.971 Dean:    good breeze
2023-03-14 13:35:30.060 Dean:    washing on the line

2023-03-13 13:18:46.443 Dean:    so I will synch across later
2023-03-13 13:18:40.016 Dean:    I don't have dropbox on that m/c
2023-03-13 13:16:15.746 Dean:    so we should see an improvement
2023-03-13 13:16:02.423 Dean:    I have a 4.8ghz cpu in the fast desktop
2023-03-13 13:15:18.088 Dean:    send URL please
2023-03-13 13:15:10.443 Dean:    I will test it shortly for you
2023-03-13 13:15:00.007 Dean:    
2023-03-13 13:14:48.135 Dean:    I suppose that is commensurate with the cpu speed difference
2023-03-13 13:13:21.849 Dean:    That's a surprise
2023-03-13 12:14:33.993 Dean:    firefox is really losing its edge... doh!
2023-03-13 12:14:06.950 Dean:    I'll imagine it is similar on Win
2023-03-13 12:13:50.252 Dean:    as expected
2023-03-13 10:34:46.373 Dean:    and I'll bet its faster on both systems
2023-03-13 10:34:29.852 Dean:    I assume chrome miht be a good test across the board
2023-03-13 10:34:06.509 Dean:    something interesting going on there
2023-03-13 10:30:17.627 Dean:    what is the Dell CPU in comparison with the Mac?
2023-03-13 10:24:12.973 Dean:    
2023-03-13 10:24:11.507 Dean:    but for all widgets that exist in unzipped form without .widget suffix it pings an error
2023-03-13 10:23:34.289 Dean:    works fine for .widgetised files
2023-03-13 10:23:15.616 Dean:    for each of the widgets that refers directly to widget in a folder with a .KON file
2023-03-13 10:21:05.090 Dean:    I have to click through five or six error messages
2023-03-13 10:20:37.708 Dean:

2023-03-13 09:57:24.119 Dean:    i have 15 secs interval

2023-03-13 09:29:24.486 Dean:    fCW issues a command line operation to resynch the time
2023-03-13 09:27:35.779 Dean:    can you see if it has fixed it?
2023-03-13 09:27:26.780 Dean:    just used the time synch feature bilt into FCW
2023-03-13 09:25:44.945 Dean:    and painting, raking out cracks
2023-03-13 09:25:33.130 Dean:    washing day here
2023-03-13 09:24:58.672 Dean:    that might have been C++
2023-03-13 09:24:43.634 Dean:    that extracted temperatures from speedfan's shared memory area
2023-03-13 09:24:23.956 Dean:    used by the themometers widget
2023-03-13 09:24:12.004 Dean:    you also created the speedfan exe
2023-03-13 09:24:02.359 Dean:    it might be interesting to see how webassembly and other improvements fare compared to a native C implementation
2023-03-13 09:23:12.970 Dean:    speeedfan
2023-03-13 09:21:06.627 Dean:    it is sufficient
2023-03-13 09:20:57.005 Dean:    
2023-03-13 09:20:55.822 Dean:    for a scripting engine, it perhaps does not matter that much
2023-03-13 09:20:33.014 Dean:    but
2023-03-13 09:20:29.872 Dean:    but it is missing SO much that the later engines can do
2023-03-13 09:20:15.655 Dean:    as well as the mere fact that you CAN put .js on the desktop with so little effort
2023-03-13 09:19:54.912 Dean:    and a rich API /documentation
2023-03-13 09:19:34.256 Dean:    do
2023-03-13 09:19:28.549 Dean:    does...
2023-03-13 09:19:24.843 Dean:    accessibility and flexibility are what the YWE engine do well
2023-03-13 09:18:15.286 Dean:    d
2023-03-13 09:18:13.652 Dean:    almost needs a timer or a display to keep the user interested... and update
2023-03-13 09:17:43.192 Dean:    that's quite a big real difference
2023-03-13 09:17:21.549 Dean:    or implement some of the maths routines manually? or perhaps use an external C program and call it instead?
2023-03-13 09:16:31.194 Dean:    do you thing you could break down the maths into discrete sections that could run faster?
2023-03-13 09:16:09.149 Dean:    so it all depends upon what you want to do
2023-03-13 09:15:56.868 Dean:    in my experience running all my YWE on my 12 year old E6410 (3.3ghz x 4 threads), all of them doing something, uses <5% of cpu alongside all the o/s functions happening at the same time
2023-03-13 09:14:41.171 Dean:    I left it on overnight only to find my mother had turned the power off in the morning/or it had overheated and crashed
2023-03-13 09:14:08.917 Dean:    when run it completed in 5-6hrs
2023-03-13 09:13:50.333 Dean:    I was looking at some old code to plot a bell curve that I used to run on a 8bit z80 using 10,000 random points
2023-03-13 09:12:50.313 Dean:    the good thing about being here is that the speed up you receive in hardware means that the old YWE is now much faster than it would have been
2023-03-13 09:12:07.980 Dean:    Yup
2023-03-13 09:10:56.247 Dean:    excuse typos
2023-03-13 09:09:17.683 Dean:    to speed up Safari
2023-03-13 09:09:00.906 Dean:    current versions have improvements of .js engines have many improvements, I wonder if it uses webassembly?
2023-03-13 09:07:28.224 Dean:    YWE used spidermonkey and an old version obviously
2023-03-13 09:06:27.413 Dean:    Xwidget, I believe used the Trident engine from MS
2023-03-13 09:06:02.660 Dean:    I presume the YWE for both o/s operates within its own browser context provided by the technology at that time
2023-03-13 09:05:29.998 Dean:    
2023-03-13 09:05:00.703 Dean:    worth noting in the YWE oddities file
2023-03-13 09:04:50.330 Dean:    [quote] Came across another YWE oddity - assigment of an array to a textarea does not convert to text on YWE. [/quote] 
2023-03-13 09:03:49.890 Dean:    vs the browsers available there
2023-03-13 09:03:19.928 Dean:    it would be interesting to see how those figures compare to running on Windows
2023-03-13 09:02:59.692 Dean:    [quote] Running on Safari is sometimes about 7-10 times faster than on YWE, but not always. [/quote]

2023-03-12 23:32:16.775 Dean:    Night Night!
2023-03-12 18:05:19.846 Dean:    lucky you!
2023-03-12 16:49:02.438 Dean:    SD now runs processes elevated if required, tested, it works
2023-03-12 15:13:16.980 Dean:    for comparison purposes
2023-03-12 15:13:10.042 Dean:    now have two screens  on my lappie, one is running SD, the other RD
2023-03-12 15:12:40.773 Dean:    
2023-03-12 15:12:28.135 Dean:    not only were my VB6 projs a teaching/training aid but they now have a future
2023-03-12 15:11:55.579 Dean:    it already compiles compex apps
2023-03-12 15:11:45.473 Dean:    within a year...
2023-03-12 15:11:36.528 Dean:    news - TwinBasic is flying towards completion, the VB6 community will have a new IDE, fully compatible BASIC language with significant language extensions to supply modern features and the ability to create 64bit apps!
2023-03-12 15:10:10.960 Dean:    
2023-03-12 15:10:08.141 Dean:    disabled
2023-03-12 15:10:01.263 Dean:    as it is disbaled by Windows to drag to elevated apps
2023-03-12 15:09:47.961 Dean:    running as non-admin also means that drag/drop to the dock  now works
2023-03-12 15:09:22.630 Dean:    
2023-03-12 15:09:21.288 Dean:    for specific apps
2023-03-12 15:09:15.430 Dean:    that should elevate
2023-03-12 15:09:06.516 Dean:    and the runCommand function will pick that up shortly and execute a shell execute with the "runas" option
2023-03-12 15:08:25.134 Dean:    it can be set per icon in the settings utility
2023-03-12 15:08:09.827 Dean:    added a new option for each icon to run Elevated
2023-03-12 15:07:56.585 Dean:    all working fine
2023-03-12 15:07:49.447 Dean:    VB6, been running it as a local user since I have removed the option to run from Rocketdock's registry
2023-03-12 15:07:05.348 Dean:    
2023-03-12 15:06:57.851 Dean:    had a lovely walk in the cold sun

2023-03-10 13:33:45.459 Dean:    
2023-03-10 13:33:44.428 Dean:     as you planned it
2023-03-10 13:33:38.363 Dean:    nice when something works...
2023-03-10 13:33:28.934 Dean:    using an array to store any recently disabled icons and redirect the function to use the transparent image
2023-03-10 13:32:52.603 Dean:    I have to create two new transparent images on the fly and display those instead
2023-03-10 13:32:25.565 Dean:    Just managed to make SD disable an icon in the dock using reduced opacity
2023-03-10 13:20:47.231 Dean:    hmmm

2023-03-10 00:17:14.542 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2023-03-09 18:19:24.182 Dean:    loads them into the dictionary and then diverts the routine that displays the icon to immediately display the transparent copies
2023-03-09 18:18:29.293 Dean:    VB6 SD - I am modifying the code so that when an icon is disabled, it creates small and large semi opaque icon copies
2023-03-09 18:17:30.647 Dean:    
2023-03-09 18:17:19.945 Dean:    if the temperature drops tomorrow and I expect that it will, the snow will land and not melt
2023-03-09 17:51:03.119 Dean:    text fields in YWidget use .data and Xwidgt uses .text
2023-03-09 17:50:32.608 Dean:    when you 'know' that everything works and is good
2023-03-09 17:50:15.513 Dean:    hard to find
2023-03-09 17:50:03.758 Dean:    some things Xwidget did better
2023-03-09 17:49:48.911 Dean:    yes, an old problem that stymied me too when converting from YWidgets to Xwidget
2023-03-09 16:17:16.626 Dean:    snowed here all day but did not settle
2023-03-09 16:17:01.534 Dean:    just a leftover of my childhood I suppose
2023-03-09 16:16:46.499 Dean:    I still like my birthday celebrations (such as they are) on my actual b'day
2023-03-09 16:16:19.067 Dean:    best to get it out of the way I suppose
2023-03-09 14:57:29.775 Dean:    are you getting together for a celebration?

2023-03-08 15:13:32.004 Dean:    Very strange that I cannot remember that working

2023-03-08 14:54:00.271 Dean:    I'll have that
2023-03-08 14:53:53.383 Dean:    oh!
2023-03-08 14:52:30.501 Dean:    and I lost the will to complete it
2023-03-08 14:52:14.802 Dean:    when YWE failed
2023-03-08 14:52:05.039 Dean:    and I tried to create a steamy version of it

2023-03-05 14:46:50.595 Dean:    [quote] More or less fell out of the Kaprekar code. [/quote] 
2023-03-05 14:29:47.949 Dean:    I will write the debug statements to a logfile instead
2023-03-05 14:29:30.084 Dean:    and eventually will be bound to fall foul with future o/s hardening
2023-03-05 14:29:11.045 Dean:    as that causes problems with a/v tools
2023-03-05 14:28:56.730 Dean:    I will remove the debug utility too, the persistentDebug.exe
2023-03-05 14:28:28.361 Dean:    so I can reduce the requirements on the tool for admin level access in the program manifest
2023-03-05 14:27:55.415 Dean:    as we do not need to access the registry to write the values any more
2023-03-05 14:27:34.842 Dean:    Removing the rocketdock code has a beneficial effect of no longer needing administrator access
2023-03-05 13:54:40.557 Dean:    but it is easier to have three separate banks of code with common libraries
2023-03-05 13:54:14.901 Dean:    I could combine the code and create one big binary
2023-03-05 13:53:50.405 Dean:    it was always a weakness that the utilities were operating eparate from each other
2023-03-05 13:53:24.790 Dean:    It is good to see them interacting with each other
2023-03-05 13:52:03.617 Dean:    and I have settled on a msgbox and user interaction
2023-03-05 13:51:44.030 Dean:    I am just deciding what I want to do when changes occur 
2023-03-05 13:51:14.907 Dean:    
2023-03-05 13:51:11.312 Dean:    the dock and the utilities use the same file and I am keeping track of which utility is making changes
2023-03-05 13:50:39.469 Dean:    and then a map refresh is offered
2023-03-05 13:50:24.932 Dean:    the VB6 settings tool now pops up a msgbox when the dock config is changed by the dock
2023-03-05 13:49:37.039 Dean:    
2023-03-05 13:49:33.224 Dean:    as a one off
2023-03-05 13:49:26.592 Dean:    or extract from the registry
2023-03-05 13:49:17.111 Dean:    to convert an existing RD settings file
2023-03-05 13:49:00.357 Dean:    and will re-use it for a conversion tool
2023-03-05 13:48:48.268 Dean:    I will retain some of it, commented out
2023-03-05 13:48:33.285 Dean:    still quite a lot
2023-03-05 13:48:22.734 Dean:    I've been stripping the Rocketdock code from the iconsettings tool
2023-03-05 13:48:04.337 Dean:    good
2023-03-05 13:03:00.065 Dean:    that widget
2023-03-05 13:02:54.836 Dean:    that could be useful

2023-03-01 14:37:10.797 Dean:    Hmmm
2023-03-01 13:54:49.823 Dean:    FCW now deals with being off screen as well
2023-03-01 13:38:32.622 Dean:    I've never owned a touch screen PC (conventional laptop/desktop)
2023-03-01 10:32:42.679 Dean:    all working, will apply the same code to FCW as well
2023-03-01 09:19:35.083 Dean:    This sort of code is rquired for every single Windows program but I imaging 95% just don't bother
2023-03-01 09:18:55.212 Dean:    but it is working
2023-03-01 09:18:50.761 Dean:    quite a few APIs in play
2023-03-01 09:18:37.175 Dean:    then it places the current form/window back on the visible portion of the display
2023-03-01 09:18:02.767 Dean:    workinn on code to find the the virtual top/left andbottom/right so that if a window is beyond those bounds after a resolution or screen change
2023-03-01 09:17:00.051 Dean:    as when two/three screens are involved the display becomes a virtual rectangle
2023-03-01 09:16:30.424 Dean:    In VB6/windows forcing a window back on screen is more difficult than expected

2023-03-01 08:27:59.726 Dean:    Good Morning!
2023-02-28 11:17:22.263 Dean:    so, it is good to review and fix some elements
2023-02-28 11:17:05.546 Dean:    but my code was not good in parts and I was learning
2023-02-28 11:16:46.565 Dean:    in the icon settings tool
2023-02-28 11:15:53.194 Dean:    I managed to make the UI as perfect as I could make it, with recent-ish changes
2023-02-28 11:15:31.345 Dean:    couldn't be more true

2023-02-28 11:02:38.461 Dean:    I started the icon settings tool
2023-02-28 11:02:23.533 Dean:     and improving things in the knowledge of what I've learnt since
2023-02-28 11:01:57.343 Dean:    removing dead code
2023-02-28 11:01:45.998 Dean:    
2023-02-28 11:01:42.225 Dean:    and for all subroutines I am explicitly forcing byVal or byRef on all parameters passed
2023-02-28 11:00:49.067 Dean:    adding initialisation  to all declared vars
2023-02-28 11:00:33.338 Dean:    in addition, in the icon settings tool I am tidying the code
2023-02-28 11:00:17.383 Dean:    
2023-02-28 11:00:01.423 Dean:    so, adding code to handle that
2023-02-28 10:59:54.009 Dean:    then it will always restart off screen
2023-02-28 10:59:30.818 Dean:    if they store an x.y position onto a monitor that becomes disconnected for some reason
2023-02-28 10:59:01.894 Dean:    also getting the utilities to handle being off screen
2023-02-28 10:58:28.300 Dean:    it now handles that
2023-02-28 10:58:22.030 Dean:    because that can move SD to the wrong part of the screen
2023-02-28 10:57:59.866 Dean:    and then to handle changes to resolution
2023-02-28 10:57:40.976 Dean:    I've been forcing the SD utilities to remember their old location
2023-02-28 10:52:25.916 Dean:     too much to do
2023-02-28 10:52:20.853 Dean:    stressed!

2023-02-23 23:31:42.816 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-02-23 23:31:38.592 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2023-02-23 22:44:17.103 Dean:    but the new cables follow the old cable layout
2023-02-23 22:44:02.290 Dean:    new consumer unit
2023-02-23 22:43:57.012 Dean:    old electrics!
2023-02-23 22:43:43.460 Dean:    we have spurs here, no rings
2023-02-23 22:43:28.493 Dean:    have not yet wired into the lighting spur, have two more uplighters to do before I go up in the loft and wire in all three 
2023-02-23 22:42:46.047 Dean:    fitted an uplighter to one wall in place of a hanging lamp that hangs down to my shoulder...
2023-02-23 22:41:59.713 Dean:    modern bakelite switch, safe.
2023-02-23 22:41:41.669 Dean:    replacing it with a bakelite switch on a double pateras
2023-02-23 22:41:22.041 Dean:    removed a 1980s light switch in my bedroom, fixed the plaster behind that had crumbled
2023-02-23 16:40:11.002 Dean:    sent above

2023-02-23 14:11:33.199 Dean:    I have little faith
2023-02-23 14:11:27.329 Dean:    to see what they can find/fix
2023-02-23 14:11:17.467 Dean:    trying various in-built diagnosis tools
2023-02-23 14:09:36.336 Dean:    a laptop restart will fix it
2023-02-23 14:09:25.412 Dean:    this is the local network
2023-02-23 14:09:20.494 Dean:    in is not
2023-02-23 14:09:16.309 Dean:    out is fine
2023-02-23 14:09:11.594 Dean:    twice today it has decided only to work one way
2023-02-23 14:08:50.835 Dean:    every now and then networking/notworking will start to act up
2023-02-23 14:08:23.574 Dean:    Windows networking is really rubbish - confirmed
2023-02-23 13:14:24.530 DeanFastPC:    However, FCW is updating correctly
2023-02-23 13:14:13.009 DeanFastPC:    
2023-02-23 13:14:05.010 DeanFastPC:    stupid windows and its inability to lock correctly
2023-02-23 13:13:41.995 DeanFastPC:    but no on the main system
2023-02-23 13:13:34.210 DeanFastPC:    I can edit it using external editor on the 2nd system
2023-02-23 13:13:03.378 DeanFastPC:    I can modify it with two systems using FCW
2023-02-23 13:12:47.266 DeanFastPC:    Windows has managed to get its knickers in a twist over who owns the output file
2023-02-23 13:12:05.266 DeanFastPC:    
2023-02-23 13:12:02.962 DeanFastPC:    bright sky now but thin cloud cover
2023-02-23 13:10:10.283 DeanFastPC:    still testing
2023-02-23 13:08:17.170 DeanFastPC:    did have an access violation error when attempting to edit the output file on the local original pc
2023-02-23 13:06:21.421 Dean:    testing
2023-02-23 13:04:44.946 DeanFastPC:    hope to get that drilled and fitted today and wired in

2023-02-23 13:03:25.490 DeanFastPC:    I am drilling holes in the wall to fit an uplighter
2023-02-23 13:03:01.162 DeanFastPC:    
2023-02-23 13:02:58.380 DeanFastPC:    simultaneously
2023-02-23 13:01:41.504 Dean:    on two systems
2023-02-23 13:01:36.395 Dean:    Nice to have it working without issues
2023-02-23 13:00:58.732 Dean:    all good
2023-02-23 13:00:21.467 DeanFastPC:    just put it back
2023-02-23 13:00:15.458 DeanFastPC:    the testing of the output file date/time had been removed for speed optimisation
2023-02-23 12:59:48.330 DeanFastPC:    fixed
2023-02-23 12:59:37.554 DeanFastPC:    fixing another small one
2023-02-23 12:45:49.595 Dean:    partially
2023-02-23 12:45:08.364 DeanFastPC:    one bug fixed
2023-02-23 12:40:51.300 DeanFastPC:    
2023-02-23 12:40:48.835 DeanFastPC:    there is a problem...
2023-02-23 12:39:28.771 DeanFastPC:    you might see a few test lines
2023-02-23 12:35:49.051 DeanFastPC:    there is a delay in the sending/updating that slows FCW a little
2023-02-23 12:35:14.994 DeanFastPC:    want to determine if it causes any issues updating the local share from another PC
2023-02-23 12:34:00.627 DeanFastPC:    just seeing how that goes
2023-02-23 12:33:46.555 DeanFastPC:    so Dropbox is not running on this PC
2023-02-23 12:33:32.914 DeanFastPC:    Accessing FCW from the desktop system using a local share to the same dropbox files
2023-02-23 12:32:36.019 DeanFastPC:    not able to comment with any knowledge

2023-02-23 09:49:01.123 Dean:    dropbox crashed

2023-02-22 15:41:08.977 Dean:    Working on several mini projects, dilutes the effort but makes coding bearable, and you?
2023-02-22 15:40:46.721 Dean:    Any interesting things to tell me?
2023-02-22 11:32:30.839 Dean:    just testing to see what sort of issues will arise running on two systems
2023-02-22 11:31:06.184 Dean:    adding functionality to suppress the alarms with a checkbox in the config and then in the msgboxes
2023-02-22 11:30:26.926 Dean:    I am running FCW on two systems simultaneously so forgive any wobbles
2023-02-22 11:29:49.181 Dean:    I understand really, I am just being facetious
2023-02-22 11:29:34.765 Dean:    of course!
2023-02-22 11:29:31.325 Dean:    [quote] It's just a nice coding exercise - I don't think the maths will have any practical use, but you never know! [/quote]

2023-02-21 20:50:35.868 Dean:    and have been relegated to the dead pile
2023-02-21 20:50:26.823 Dean:    three failed inspection
2023-02-21 20:50:15.271 Dean:    it will no longer act as a HD

2023-02-21 20:49:43.387 Dean:    not yet sure
2023-02-21 20:49:39.702 Dean:    will probably act a storage for image backups, films &c
2023-02-21 20:49:18.099 Dean:    that are not yet being used
2023-02-21 20:49:06.701 Dean:    and then some of 1TB-2TB, just three or four
2023-02-21 20:48:38.013 Dean:    normally pre-SSD upgrade drives

2023-02-21 09:53:10.595 Dean:    or does that cause serious problems?
2023-02-21 09:52:46.508 Dean:    can there be local differences?
2023-02-21 09:52:01.307 Dean:    sorry, I thought the UPS had the frequency measured too
2023-02-21 09:51:30.130 Dean:    still surprisingly capable
2023-02-21 09:51:13.492 Dean:    those current components are all usable but are generation 4, about 10 years old
2023-02-21 09:50:29.164 Dean:    I will upgrade the mobo, CPU and GPU
2023-02-21 09:50:06.390 Dean:    when the metalwork is done and the components all installed and working
2023-02-21 09:49:24.821 Dean:    that I will use to create mounting points
2023-02-21 09:49:14.549 Dean:    the mobo for that is my previous mobo
2023-02-21 09:48:39.070 Dean:    using the high quality apple case

2023-02-21 09:45:57.310 Dean:    can you check the frequency against your gauges to determine the local difference?

2023-02-21 09:38:24.973 Dean:    worth looking at
2023-02-21 09:38:18.765 Dean:    there are  some very niceNVME coolers for not much money, alu. heat sinks with built in fan
2023-02-21 09:37:27.934 Dean:    as they are damaged if used for long periods over that point
2023-02-21 09:37:08.504 Dean:    nvme drives should not exceed 70C
2023-02-21 09:36:23.780 Dean:    they just haven't updated the alarm threshold
2023-02-21 09:36:12.015 Dean:    h
2023-02-21 09:36:10.222 Dean:    perfectly normal eat levels though
2023-02-21 09:36:01.646 Dean:    and crystaldiskinfo, that I use for drive thermal/SMART stats shows a red lamp on the heat levels
2023-02-21 09:35:22.393 Dean:    the nvme cards run hotter than SSDs, 50C vs 34C
2023-02-21 09:33:27.506 Dean:    very quiet in operation and hopefully quicker to boot  and operate too (minisculy I imagine)
2023-02-21 09:32:54.167 Dean:    all done now
2023-02-21 09:32:43.449 Dean:    The SATA cables are horizontally plugged instead of vertically, so difficult to thread and insert
2023-02-21 09:32:11.337 Dean:    it was a struggle
2023-02-21 09:32:05.338 Dean:    but in the confines of a medium-sized tower case with a long double-sized GPU
2023-02-21 09:31:23.944 Dean:    which is good
2023-02-21 09:31:17.346 Dean:    it seems to have grown in shielding and cable size
2023-02-21 09:31:01.837 Dean:    like the 60/70s era cabling!
2023-02-21 09:30:50.005 Dean:    more difficult than expected as the cabling is very bulky these days
2023-02-21 09:30:29.580 Dean:    also installed a DVD drive and multiple card reader at the same time so I can read more or less any standard media
2023-02-21 09:29:41.792 Dean:    will attempt to boot BIOS and set the NVMe as the boot drive shortly and see how that goes

2023-02-20 11:53:06.648 Dean:    rebooting

2023-02-20 11:50:51.280 Dean:    I ran a diagnostic at the h/w level

2023-02-12 11:16:31.495 Dean:    and finally the last flying vulcan did circuits around the goodwood revival a few years back now
2023-02-12 11:15:45.177 Dean:    I also remember sheltering beneath one from the rain at Abingdon air show, there were hundreds of us taking shelter
2023-02-12 11:15:02.882 Dean:    The vulcan filled the sky
2023-02-12 11:14:45.191 Dean:    I fell off the dune

2023-02-11 18:27:30.268 Dean:    and appropriate for her
2023-02-11 18:27:16.389 Dean:    certainly, clean and well maintained
2023-02-11 18:26:24.915 Dean:    been to see mum in her new home
2023-02-11 18:26:17.746 Dean:    
2023-02-11 18:26:14.962 Dean:    it should be quite adequate as a replacement switch
2023-02-11 18:25:51.653 Dean:    the switch itself is twice the expected size
2023-02-11 18:25:27.648 Dean:    they are much beefier than expected
2023-02-11 18:25:15.536 Dean:    The switches arrived
2023-02-11 10:53:10.561 Dean:    they are being created for cars, racing requires light weight, small batteries
2023-02-11 10:52:33.913 Dean:    I don't know about nimhs
2023-02-11 10:52:19.359 Dean:    the lead acid will survive for years
2023-02-11 10:52:07.708 Dean:    as the current UPS would probably not be able to handle the charging requirements of a nimh battery
2023-02-11 10:51:20.624 Dean:    but I imagine they would need some internal circuitry
2023-02-11 10:51:05.047 Dean:    I understand that direct replacement batteries are being developed
2023-02-11 10:50:43.171 Dean:    when there are cheap high capacity nimh batteries that could replace the lead acid cell, it could be upgraded
2023-02-11 10:37:12.120 Dean:    Good price
2023-02-11 10:35:15.236 Dean:    at least with that new inline switch I can replace the micro switch
2023-02-11 10:34:25.246 Dean:    switches being made under spec. is not a surprise
2023-02-11 10:25:59.324 Dean:    The picture is correct there but the descriptive text on that advert is totally wrong
2023-02-11 10:24:29.424 Dean:    https://www.aliexpress.com/i/1005002140882837.html
2023-02-11 10:22:48.151 Dean:    the new switches are chunky
2023-02-11 10:22:36.488 Dean:    but I checked at the time
2023-02-11 10:22:24.759 Dean:    I don't have the wattage of the PSU near me at the mo'
2023-02-11 10:21:47.869 Dean:    can't turn it off
2023-02-11 10:21:40.396 Dean:    it welded the switch inline
2023-02-11 10:21:16.683 Dean:    it lasted a few months of usage before overheating
2023-02-11 10:20:54.830 Dean:    so it was clearly not up to the job
2023-02-11 10:20:36.854 Dean:    the amperage passing through it was less than it should have been able to cope with
2023-02-11 10:20:06.580 Dean:    and was clearly not up to the job
2023-02-11 10:19:50.061 Dean:    r
2023-02-11 10:19:47.212 Dean:    but it had melted the intenal structure
2023-02-11 10:19:16.668 Dean:    I had been using an inline 5a/6a switch on the PSU to my bike
2023-02-11 10:18:19.664 Dean:    so I can turn such a power line on/off
2023-02-11 10:17:44.502 Dean:    I have just bought some inline switches 16amp
2023-02-11 10:16:09.034 Dean:    Top o' the morning to you!
2023-02-10 18:38:41.037 Dean:    and C is not just the scripting language
2023-02-10 18:38:27.898 Dean:    unless speed is an issue
2023-02-10 18:38:19.577 Dean:    I would avoid writing in C when there are other languages that would do as well
2023-02-10 14:51:50.295 Dean:    looking now
2023-02-10 12:29:28.544 Dean:    
2023-02-10 12:29:25.688 Dean:    It leaves you with the feeling that all Americans are vile
2023-02-10 12:29:04.962 Dean:    rather an awful but probably realistic take on the classic Western
2023-02-10 12:14:15.623 Dean:    Have you watched  "The English" on BBC?
2023-02-10 12:04:52.815 Dean:    that might be a useful candidate for migrating to NW to see how well the desktop APIs allow that sort of access
2023-02-10 12:04:15.757 Dean:    I'd say the chances are slim
2023-02-10 12:03:50.941 Dean:    you'll have to run firecall for windows on Wine?

2023-02-10 12:03:01.040 Dean:    Dropbox just died on me
2023-02-10 12:02:47.918 Dean:    I'd love to see desktop with all those running
2023-02-10 12:02:28.394 Dean:    then you'd be able to keep the legacy going
2023-02-10 12:02:18.888 Dean:    if you can convert as many of them to desktop NW
2023-02-10 12:02:03.341 Dean:    still doing a useful job
2023-02-10 12:01:54.543 Dean:    I still have the widgets running on all my PCs
2023-02-10 12:01:28.976 Dean:    we enjoyed one that was almost multiplatform
2023-02-10 12:01:11.445 Dean:    very few languages/engines were truly multiplatform
2023-02-10 10:46:53.994 Dean:    I'll have a new version for you soon 
2023-02-10 10:41:35.157 Dean:    also painting a bedroom final top coat
2023-02-10 10:41:16.699 Dean:    not yet tested
2023-02-10 10:41:12.729 Dean:    added the stub code to run a second app before and after as well as adding the app to terminate code in the main dock
2023-02-10 10:40:32.620 Dean:    I've done some coding
2023-02-10 10:40:13.870 Dean:    Top o' the morning to you!
2023-02-09 21:26:16.624 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-02-09 21:26:13.534 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2023-02-09 14:16:04.779 Dean:    It is good to have the cpability to modify a program that you use daily in order to make it operate the way you want it to.
2023-02-09 14:14:54.856 Dean:    shoudl be reasonably straightforward
2023-02-09 14:14:42.024 Dean:    now I just need to re-use existing code from SD to operate it as required in SD itself
2023-02-09 14:14:10.896 Dean:    all the logic is there to set and save
2023-02-09 14:14:00.135 Dean:    all implemented in the iconSettings tool, with all the underlying params saved/read correctly
2023-02-09 14:13:28.947 Dean:    anyway, that is the idea
2023-02-09 14:13:21.260 Dean:    and it will do so before Quake I is fired up
2023-02-09 14:13:00.639 Dean:    if I forget to close it neatly I can enter the yahoowidgets.exe as the a2pp to terminate
2023-02-09 14:12:37.325 Dean:    when I run Quake I, I would prefer it if they YW engine was closed beforehand
2023-02-09 14:12:06.547 Dean:    for example
2023-02-09 14:12:03.269 Dean:    sometimes you might want to kill an existing application prior to running another
2023-02-09 14:11:39.122 Dean:    also an application to terminate
2023-02-09 14:11:23.603 Dean:    <><>propertiesPanelLarge.png
2023-02-09 14:10:49.359 Dean:    VB6 SD, added options to start the secondary additional program before/after the application initiated
2023-02-09 14:09:57.423 Dean:    lunch for me was crumpets and Christmas Stilton
2023-02-09 14:09:38.038 Dean:    still though, unpleasant to lose another bit of my body!
2023-02-09 14:09:18.843 Dean:    it was a wisdom tooth anyway and came out in 10 mins
2023-02-09 14:08:55.321 Dean:    since the tooth was extracted
2023-02-09 14:08:44.144 Dean:    no, nothing
2023-02-09 14:08:37.332 Dean:    but painful to eat hot/cold on that side
2023-02-09 14:08:23.498 Dean:    cotrolled by ibuprofen and salt washes
2023-02-09 14:08:04.679 Dean:    was painful

2023-02-04 16:22:31.074 Dean:    I'll give it as go

2023-02-04 12:04:27.687 Dean:    using the defined co-ords only when they are set by the user
2023-02-04 12:04:11.373 Dean:    and in addition it should only place itself back on screen again just enough to get back on screen
2023-02-04 12:03:40.353 Dean:    and the setting of the x,y co-ords needs to be manual
2023-02-04 12:03:19.898 Dean:    I suppose it needs to take into account the position of the leftmost portion of the widget in releation to the screen right before it moves itself
2023-02-04 11:43:35.950 Dean:    only after playing quake I as a trial
2023-02-04 11:42:12.011 Dean:    same thing occurred and it jumps from the right hand position close to the border, straight to the middle line and across the centre
2023-02-04 11:41:34.181 Dean:    on my new laptop
2023-02-04 11:35:18.900 Dean:    I'll make changes later to fix it
2023-02-04 11:34:41.951 Dean:    and you cannot unset except for setting debug and then viewing/handling prefs
2023-02-04 11:34:10.328 Dean:    in that meantime s.ngr sampled the screen, determined new position and set it
2023-02-04 11:33:49.309 Dean:    then you set it to the res you require
2023-02-04 11:33:39.214 Dean:    ran Quake I which starts at low res
2023-02-04 11:33:26.039 Dean:    I have a full screen game on two laptops and the positioning problem started on each after the resolution changes
2023-02-04 11:32:51.077 Dean:    that locks it in position making it unmoveable and stores the x/y pos at the same time
2023-02-04 11:32:27.971 Dean:    clicking on the red lamp top right for instance
2023-02-04 11:32:14.283 Dean:    I think it might be wise to stick in position only when user requests it
2023-02-04 11:31:48.808 Dean:    if the screen res. changes then it sets the new position and then you are stuck with it
2023-02-04 11:31:26.427 Dean:    it seems to be the fact taht i ti si regularly setting and sampling
2023-02-04 11:31:05.700 Dean:    I've figured out what seems to cause startupmgr to move across the screen
2023-02-04 11:30:28.955 Dean:    Good Morning!

2023-02-03 17:03:01.883 Dean:    now it is moving 350 or more
2023-02-03 17:02:48.012 Dean:    previously it only moved a 100 pixels or so
2023-02-03 17:02:25.915 Dean:    and it proples itslef to the middle after a few seconds or so
2023-02-03 17:02:08.711 Dean:    I place it bottom right
2023-02-03 17:01:58.076 Dean:    Startup manager is now moving itself across half the screen

2023-01-30 11:48:01.052 Dean:    and store that as an additional icon in the collection and point to that instead
2023-01-30 11:47:44.770 Dean:    what I will do is to create a transparent version of the icon on the fly

2023-01-30 11:46:59.538 Dean:    GDI+ only allows you to add an additional icon with different opacity
2023-01-30 11:46:29.438 Dean:    disable option changes the opacity of the disabled icon but only after a restart
2023-01-30 11:45:40.312 Dean:    just testing
2023-01-30 11:45:35.892 Dean:    The new version of SD will come shortly

2023-01-30 11:44:30.998 Dean:    don't know how to do that
2023-01-30 11:44:19.590 Dean:    need to register as a drop app - weird system Windows is becoming
2023-01-30 11:43:54.760 Dean:    drag and drop to the dock is no longer working in win10/11

2023-01-30 11:42:09.971 Dean:    and restart the dock option on the menu
2023-01-30 11:41:57.732 Dean:    and disable icon
2023-01-30 11:41:46.099 Dean:    VB6 SD new functionality - clone icon

2023-01-27 12:01:29.533 Dean:    agreed
2023-01-27 11:55:04.412 Dean:    I'll have a think about that
2023-01-27 11:26:48.743 Dean:    it would be nice to have a scheme that could handle that
2023-01-27 11:26:35.875 Dean:    but...
2023-01-27 11:26:33.678 Dean:    not that you are likely to ever do that
2023-01-27 11:26:24.224 Dean:    also writing with one instance and then with another could cause problems
2023-01-27 11:25:49.797 Dean:    something that takes very little cpu and can happen with little delay
2023-01-27 11:25:24.750 Dean:    That would be my simple solution
2023-01-27 11:25:11.363 Dean:    that could trigger the main timer to pull the data
2023-01-27 11:24:57.597 Dean:    it would be useful to have another timer on a much tighter interval that looked for a flag set
2023-01-27 11:24:32.971 Dean:    but
2023-01-27 11:24:30.559 Dean:    Well, it happens on an interval
2023-01-27 10:34:44.506 Dean:    any thoughts as to a simple scheme?
2023-01-27 10:34:34.302 Dean:    so I can have FCW open on multiple machines simultaneously
2023-01-27 10:34:12.478 Dean:    what would be the best way to keep multiple instances of FCW on different machines in synch?
2023-01-27 10:33:47.455 Dean:    with FCW and EC for .js
2023-01-27 10:33:31.562 Dean:    So, question for you
2023-01-27 10:32:21.452 Dean:    my boy is sick today
2023-01-27 10:32:11.274 Dean:    at least with regard to the taskbar
2023-01-27 10:31:58.908 Dean:    I feel like I have been released from Microsoft's UI shackles
2023-01-27 10:31:41.136 Dean:    
2023-01-27 10:31:39.567 Dean:    unlike Win11's taskbar that can only be placed at the bottom!
2023-01-27 10:31:20.251 Dean:    you can also move the taskbar manually to anywhere on te screen
2023-01-27 10:31:03.494 Dean:    and retrobar completes the picture giving a Win classic taskbar
2023-01-27 10:30:42.248 Dean:    that gives the classic windows menu experience
2023-01-27 10:30:31.225 Dean:    using "open shell" for the start menu
2023-01-27 10:30:14.398 Dean:    win 7, 8, 10 & 11
2023-01-27 10:30:06.453 Dean:    I now have a common taskbar on all my Windows systems
2023-01-27 10:29:47.137 Dean:    have a look

2023-01-20 17:15:33.354 Dean:    so now we sample the size of the small images once and use that for all the reduced size icons
2023-01-20 17:15:01.333 Dean:    I have managed to restructure the code and it makes it much easier to tune
2023-01-20 17:14:36.188 Dean:    managed to tune VB6 SD quite considerably, I was calculating the size of each icon every animation, for the big icons as well as the static ones
2023-01-20 11:57:19.648 Dean:    cold sausage roll for breakfast
2023-01-20 11:56:56.895 Dean:    a little cold but now used to it
2023-01-20 11:56:49.751 Dean:    roads clear
2023-01-20 11:56:46.381 Dean:    not deep but staying

2023-01-19 10:40:35.531 Dean:    Morning!
2023-01-18 20:48:27.795 Dean:    a couple of interesting articles (the former more so for you I think)
2023-01-18 20:47:59.685 Dean:    https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/10/openvms_92/

2023-01-16 23:04:35.179 Dean:    I'm off to London this weekend
2023-01-16 23:04:26.804 Dean:    thankyou
2023-01-16 23:00:52.766 Dean:    lots of wealthy tosspots in the middle unaffected by what is going on around them
2023-01-16 23:00:25.757 Dean:    impressive feat
2023-01-16 23:00:13.088 Dean:    adding three stories on top of a living hotel without removing guests and digging down four or five levels below the concrete slab
2023-01-16 22:26:04.070 Dean:    on the BBC
2023-01-16 22:26:00.107 Dean:    Nothing like the digging they are doing under Claridges, have you seen the three episodes?
2023-01-16 22:25:21.740 Dean:    I'll have to do some digging!
2023-01-16 18:36:23.472 Dean:    and it makes a little sense on my part to try that again
2023-01-16 18:36:01.698 Dean:    I have a win11 laptop now that I cannot ignore
2023-01-16 18:35:48.245 Dean:    did you ever manage to get more advanced widgets operating that accessed metrics from the local machine?
2023-01-16 18:35:10.521 Dean:    clocks and suchlike
2023-01-16 18:35:04.918 Dean:    As far as I can remember, you managed to get certain widgets working on Win10/11
2023-01-16 18:34:23.853 Dean:    What progress did we make on the node.js widgets?
2023-01-16 18:31:32.474 Dean:    settled a bit
2023-01-16 18:31:27.165 Dean:    hail/snow here now
2023-01-16 14:19:45.610 Dean:

2023-01-16 14:19:31.891 Dean:    afternoon
2023-01-16 01:41:22.105 Dean:    it seems to be sufficient at the moment
2023-01-16 01:41:09.518 Dean:    so the msgbox appears on top
2023-01-16 01:40:56.808 Dean:    I have added a call to make the process we are killing go to BACK
2023-01-16 01:40:32.365 Dean:    I am not going to implement an async msgbox as that will require a dock overhaul to make tasks asynchronous in general
2023-01-16 01:39:59.240 Dean:    so, the dock freezes until the msgbox is answered but you can't see it as it is behind the window
2023-01-16 01:39:27.545 Dean:    VB6 SD When killing a running process that has a high zOrder the msgbox to confirm deletion of its processes, might appear behind the window it is meant to be killing
2023-01-16 01:37:45.547 Dean:    
2023-01-15 23:22:46.198 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2023-01-15 14:48:41.569 Dean:    almost
2023-01-15 14:48:37.815 Dean:    starting to become sunny here too
2023-01-15 14:02:19.987 Dean:    progress made on all fronts
2023-01-15 14:02:11.092 Dean:    these are all plans of course with some vestigial code and investigation to see if it is possible
2023-01-15 14:01:47.164 Dean:    
2023-01-15 14:01:45.559 Dean:    I will need to maintain and save a disabled flag and test that as well as create menu options
2023-01-15 14:00:46.952 Dean:    
2023-01-15 14:00:39.457 Dean:    adding a 'disable icon' option that will cause an icon to have reduced opacity and be non-functional
2023-01-15 14:00:01.881 Dean:    
2023-01-15 13:59:31.409 Dean:    also, fixed a memory leak that consumed more and more memory over time
2023-01-15 13:59:08.000 Dean:    , removed the code that was failing to tidy up
2023-01-15 13:58:57.560 Dean:    I have fixed a faillure for the process to end, it often takes 45-60 secs for the process to die
2023-01-15 13:58:07.919 Dean:    
2023-01-15 13:58:04.815 Dean:    and I am keeping it synch'd
2023-01-15 13:57:57.540 Dean:    I have github desktop (on win7)
2023-01-15 13:57:47.524 Dean:    so much so that I have placed steamydock on github
2023-01-15 13:57:32.718 Dean:    I have become more confident of my code since I re-ordered and restructured it
2023-01-15 13:43:51.975 Dean:    good progress
2023-01-15 13:43:46.740 Dean:    
2023-01-15 13:43:39.361 Dean:    it is no more than 100 lines

2023-01-15 13:43:13.251 Dean:    so I will not dig into it
2023-01-15 13:43:05.031 Dean:    it makes heavy use of APIs and is a bit impenetrable
2023-01-15 13:42:35.362 Dean:    I have ripped out all the unnecessary code to reduce it to a fast running routine so I can use it
2023-01-15 13:41:58.780 Dean:    I have found some code that can identify the current folder path associated with the explorer window
2023-01-15 13:41:11.746 Dean:    as you cannot easily identify which icon (related to a specific folder) is associated with each icon then it is not possible to place a 'running' cog above the associated icon
2023-01-15 13:40:05.051 Dean:    it does not work for explorer processes
2023-01-15 13:39:53.477 Dean:    
2023-01-15 13:39:47.384 Dean:    to show it is running
2023-01-15 13:39:37.466 Dean:    if the array indicates then a cog is placed upon the icon
2023-01-15 13:39:17.229 Dean:    when you fire up a process it adds it to the same array immediately
2023-01-15 13:38:54.220 Dean:    vb6 SD when a item in the dock is running a timer checks for matching processes, it runs regularly but not too frequently
2023-01-15 13:37:51.889 Dean:    afternoon

2023-01-14 15:38:17.948 Dean:    horrid weather here
2023-01-14 15:36:28.906 Dean:    so modifying these and all the drag/drops are as quick as they can be
2023-01-14 15:35:48.797 Dean:    all the reordering uses the same add and delete
2023-01-14 15:35:09.287 Dean:    VB6 SD only had to modify the delete and add icon routines to fix it all
2023-01-14 15:05:45.801 Dean:    I need to test a few machines first
2023-01-14 15:05:38.425 Dean:    soon
2023-01-14 15:05:36.138 Dean:    [quote] Good! When do I get to try it? [/quote] 
2023-01-14 15:05:23.309 Dean:    afternoon
2023-01-13 23:58:55.570 Dean:    and it is now as fast as Rocketdock doing these operations
2023-01-13 23:58:41.095 Dean:    so, two problems fixed
2023-01-13 23:58:32.497 Dean:    consuming more an more memory
2023-01-13 23:58:15.733 Dean:    for each operation it grows 
2023-01-13 23:58:02.670 Dean:    the second reason is that modifying a dictionary, in any way seems not to free the old memory used by the previous objects
2023-01-13 23:57:18.787 Dean:    the main reason for this is speed as I can update an array in the blink of an eye
2023-01-13 23:56:56.781 Dean:    the image is left in the collection and not referenced
2023-01-13 23:56:33.583 Dean:    no images are now deleted, instead I keep a track of which image shoudl be displayed using an array associated with each icon position
2023-01-13 23:55:41.640 Dean:    so, I have fixed it
2023-01-13 23:55:32.214 Dean:    and on slow systems would be quite noticeable
2023-01-13 23:55:18.339 Dean:    this took time
2023-01-13 23:55:13.917 Dean:    removing the current image and then reloading only the images to the right into their new locations
2023-01-13 23:54:39.696 Dean:    this was because my code restructured the dictionary used to store the image objects
2023-01-13 23:54:09.604 Dean:    With VB6 SD previously, the deletion of an icon from the dock took a while to accomplish
2023-01-13 22:44:09.825 Dean:    Night Night!
2023-01-13 13:54:52.663 Dean:    finding it veryhard to sleep at the moment
2023-01-13 13:54:38.473 Dean:    still breezy even now
2023-01-13 13:54:09.598 Dean:    very difficult to sleep

2023-01-13 00:32:31.499 Dean:    Can you add more power in parallel?
2023-01-12 23:16:16.015 Dean:    how long does the battery last?
2023-01-12 23:07:58.182 Dean:    is your backup battery doing its job?
2023-01-12 23:07:47.446 Dean:    not good for computing
2023-01-12 23:03:42.391 Dean:    all well?

2023-01-05 11:14:45.676 Dean:    and another redrawing the dock in small mode when no animation was going on
2023-01-05 11:14:21.500 Dean:    one  as the cursor moved within the dock

2022-12-19 10:30:17.528 Dean:    scoping is being dealt with, changing some subroutines to functions where they only return a value

2022-12-17 12:23:28.954 Dean:    when dropping down the additional button options, stretch the image box downward and the controls within
2022-12-17 12:23:18.840 Dean:    and some cosmetic things in icon settings
2022-12-17 12:22:30.648 Dean:    ' a misconfigured or non-existent target shows a red X over the icon
2022-12-17 12:22:30.648 Dean:    ' Added menu option to clone current item

2022-12-15 10:38:19.874 Dean:    probably, somewhere
2022-12-15 10:35:25.626 Dean:    just the D cells from Duracell

2022-12-15 10:34:28.450 Dean:    the new D cells have a characteristic that they present as being bad due to some internal resistance or similar
2022-12-15 10:34:00.141 Dean:    
2022-12-15 10:33:52.583 Dean:    put it in the charger and it started charging

2022-12-15 10:32:28.764 Dean:    I received a replacement pair
2022-12-15 10:32:12.245 Dean:    when I placed them in my charger one failed from the first and second packets

2022-12-15 10:31:42.532 Dean:    two failed

2022-12-13 22:36:21.738 Dean:    and tested all functions
2022-12-13 22:36:09.777 Dean:    VB6 code - I have removed the redundant code referring to Rocketdock
2022-12-13 22:35:19.055 Dean:    if not done perfectly
2022-12-13 22:35:10.297 Dean:    eventually everything degrades
2022-12-13 22:34:48.037 Dean:    I have a toilet roll holder that is falling out of the wall and I used three proper rawlplugs into brick
2022-12-13 22:34:10.889 Dean:    definitely
2022-12-13 22:34:06.417 Dean:    [quote] Time will tell. [/quote] 
2022-12-13 11:50:14.111 Dean:    I can dispense with that now
2022-12-13 11:50:05.474 Dean:    I always worked with a copy of the original RD data and the format within
2022-12-13 11:49:48.196 Dean:    and the unexpected complexity that it introduced
2022-12-13 11:49:33.986 Dean:    so I am removing all that code
2022-12-13 11:49:24.127 Dean:    to co-exist with Rocketdock
2022-12-13 11:49:16.409 Dean:    it makes no sense for the dock settings nor icon settings tool
2022-12-13 11:48:58.878 Dean:    as my dock now exists (imperfectly)
2022-12-13 11:48:37.844 Dean:    it was designed to work with Rocketdock as my dock did not exist
2022-12-13 11:48:23.538 Dean:    When I created that original Rocketdock utility
2022-12-13 11:19:20.256 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-12-12 20:55:03.716 Dean:    righto
2022-12-12 17:30:06.984 Dean:    That must be why I used the locking pin as the event to set the x,y
2022-12-12 16:25:37.902 Dean:    Ah
2022-12-12 15:48:54.075 Dean:    not quite sure why it was acting like that at first
2022-12-12 15:48:43.068 Dean:    then it and it now leaves it where I place it by mouse
2022-12-12 15:48:11.254 Dean:    restarted
2022-12-12 15:48:05.649 Dean:    then I made the prefs visible, restarted, left the values as-is at 200
2022-12-12 15:47:15.330 Dean:    even when I moved it elsewhere on the screen
2022-12-12 15:47:03.603 Dean:    manager widget - as delivered it was always placing it 200 x 200
2022-12-12 15:46:11.062 Dean:    it updates the prefs x,y
2022-12-12 15:45:57.323 Dean:    when you click the locking pin
2022-12-12 15:45:42.139 Dean:    on my pz widgets, the x,y position is determined by the locking pin
2022-12-12 15:41:53.955 Dean:    where do I determine h/voffsets?
2022-12-12 15:39:32.162 Dean:    seems good so far
2022-12-12 11:24:20.126 Dean:    pulled it over but not yet tested
2022-12-12 11:23:30.653 Dean:    will report
2022-12-12 11:23:27.027 Dean:    not yet

2022-12-11 15:09:26.005 Dean:    just doing the same
2022-12-11 15:09:20.812 Dean:    [quote] Just been out to post xmas cards and give the car battery a charge. [/quote] 
2022-12-11 14:26:30.472 Dean:    I will rename the christmas baubles to advent xmas widget or thomething thimilar
2022-12-11 14:25:59.247 Dean:    I also intend to create a Days of xmas widget based upon the advent widget
2022-12-11 14:25:36.007 Dean:    I might add that later
2022-12-11 14:25:25.123 Dean:    an option through the menus
2022-12-11 14:25:15.696 Dean:    one useful option would be to have a random re-arrange
2022-12-11 14:24:56.263 Dean:    I had some thoughts about the xmas bauble widgets
2022-12-11 12:00:06.272 Dean:    understood
2022-12-10 22:54:40.743 Dean:    <><>2540.png
2022-12-10 22:52:14.084 Dean:    it is a hand-me-down from my children
2022-12-10 22:51:57.936 Dean:    The 32" screen is  an AOC
2022-12-10 22:51:41.293 Dean:    
2022-12-10 22:51:20.256 Dean:    the widget engine was designed very well
2022-12-10 22:50:49.280 Dean:    All the widgets are working well on a big screen
2022-12-10 22:46:51.214 Dean:    
2022-12-10 22:46:47.616 Dean:    if a full screen game ever pushes them off screen
2022-12-10 22:46:33.267 Dean:    and then to pop them back again
2022-12-10 22:46:18.950 Dean:    to check if the values were set
2022-12-10 22:46:06.420 Dean:    a timer would be useful though
2022-12-10 22:45:50.132 Dean:    it may have just only reorientated if there were stored values existing in the prefs
2022-12-10 22:45:20.257 Dean:    but perhaps a timer was not utilised
2022-12-10 22:45:09.340 Dean:    some event
2022-12-10 22:44:58.779 Dean:    I think that the widget recognised landscape/portrait change somehow
2022-12-10 22:43:30.881 Dean:    I am unsure as to whether I used a timer to save the x,y position on the pz widgets
2022-12-10 18:05:55.315 Dean:    will test
2022-12-10 18:05:52.114 Dean:    [quote] Version 3.3.1.   checks/corrects its position at the scanning interval. [/quote] 
2022-12-10 12:52:03.460 Dean:    and in addition Windows on tablets was not going to be a thing.
2022-12-10 12:51:46.926 Dean:    I think I started changing them all but about that time, I realised that as only you and I are the main users of the widgets it made little sense
2022-12-10 12:50:56.422 Dean:    the steampunk clock/calendar does it as well
2022-12-10 12:48:35.529 Dean:    perhaps not triggered by a timer, I cannot remember
2022-12-10 12:48:12.436 Dean:    just checked and all of the panzer widgets seem to have orientation changing code
2022-12-10 12:47:52.202 Dean:    
2022-12-10 12:40:52.400 Dean:    to orientation changes
2022-12-10 12:40:41.706 Dean:    to make them all just as responsive
2022-12-10 12:40:33.946 Dean:    I should probably modify all the remaining widgets with the same code
2022-12-10 12:40:18.994 Dean:    
2022-12-10 12:35:03.487 Dean:    it required some preference modifications to store the values
2022-12-10 12:34:47.163 Dean:    I modified a few of the widgets to cope with tablet devices
2022-12-10 12:33:05.391 Dean:    
2022-12-10 12:32:28.371 Dean:    When I thought there was a possible future for Windows on tablet devices it made sense to make the widgets more responsive to reorientation of the device
2022-12-10 12:31:46.616 Dean:    I just removed it for the startup manager
2022-12-10 12:31:34.427 Dean:    I think my panzer wireless widget had that code
2022-12-10 12:30:58.439 Dean:    I needed a timer for that which recorded the position regularly
2022-12-10 12:30:32.991 Dean:    so, on a tablet you could change the orientation and have the widget always appear in the place you wanted it to be
2022-12-10 12:30:01.106 Dean:    and would store the user defined position for both 
2022-12-10 12:29:32.877 Dean:    yes, I had a timer on another widget that monitored the change in portrait to landscape
2022-12-10 12:16:57.254 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-12-10 12:16:42.222 Dean:    Good day!
2022-12-10 01:12:11.110 Dean:    so she woke me up
2022-12-10 01:12:05.523 Dean:    Lucy came home late after dancing
2022-12-10 01:11:49.640 Dean:    putting it onscreen when it is pushed beyond the borders
2022-12-10 01:11:25.389 Dean:    for startup manager

2022-12-09 21:21:29.431 Dean:    it would be most useful if startup manager did that too
2022-12-09 21:21:14.072 Dean:    and all my widgets place themselves just on screen if they find their x/y positions to be beyond screen boundaries
2022-12-09 21:20:32.432 Dean:    I was running some full screen games
2022-12-09 21:20:15.744 Dean:    can you please make ot place itself back on screen if it finds itself off the main viewport?
2022-12-09 21:19:42.693 Dean:    Change request for you re: startup manager

2022-11-19 11:19:50.486 Dean:    Hello Harry!
2022-11-18 17:12:56.673 Dean:    crikey I was right!
2022-11-18 16:37:37.853 Dean:    so my guess was correct about the date
2022-11-18 16:37:25.108 Dean:    only just saw the date in the filename
2022-11-18 16:36:40.399 Dean:    or the position of the handlebar forward/backward might affect the operation, pull it back to disengage clutch or release brake?
2022-11-18 16:35:11.674 Dean:    the brake might be at the rear via the heel
2022-11-18 16:34:44.168 Dean:    it does beg the question of a brake...
2022-11-18 16:34:32.233 Dean:    I don't know, though there could be some goings on inside that shaft, I imagine it might be constant speed and that is a clutch
2022-11-18 16:33:26.299 Dean:    [quote] Only one cable/wire to handlebars - clutch or throttle? [/quote] 
2022-11-18 10:34:29.382 Dean:    by comparison
2022-11-18 10:34:25.926 Dean:    weather better here
2022-11-18 10:34:16.149 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-11-18 10:34:08.130 Dean:    but I suggest it is well within the motorcycle era
2022-11-18 10:33:43.433 Dean:    i think she is wearing an older style of clothes that makes it seem incongruous
2022-11-18 10:32:40.885 Dean:    it has a spark plug at the top of the cylinder
2022-11-18 10:32:11.847 Dean:    that battery would run an electric motor for approx 150 feet
2022-11-18 10:31:44.458 Dean:    and a petrol tank above the front wheel
2022-11-18 10:31:30.572 Dean:    49cc engine
2022-11-18 10:31:24.203 Dean:    it is petrol

2022-11-17 17:59:35.759 Dean:    Hello Harry!
2022-11-16 22:15:34.631 Dean:    for the work I am doing?

2022-11-15 17:50:05.027 Dean:    lots to research at the moment
2022-11-15 17:49:57.184 Dean:    I will give it a go
2022-11-15 17:41:12.852 Dean:    lots of plugins for IDEs, linting and prettying
2022-11-15 17:40:57.481 Dean:    years of maturity and stability and plenty of experience seems to make it usable now
2022-11-15 17:38:08.071 Dean:    understood
2022-11-15 17:19:25.596 Dean:    how did that work?
2022-11-15 17:11:34.712 Dean:    
2022-11-15 17:11:31.832 Dean:    I had to take a stab in the dark and I bought something fruity
2022-11-15 17:11:08.949 Dean:    
2022-11-15 17:11:06.439 Dean:    I didn't ask earlier, was the wine that I bought palatable?
2022-11-15 17:10:50.449 Dean:    
2022-11-15 17:10:46.163 Dean:    and I have to adapt regardless of my own standpoint
2022-11-15 17:10:27.447 Dean:    but I am being pulled in the direction of modern development now using up to date tools
2022-11-15 17:10:06.263 Dean:    my main system is still Win7 and YWE/VB6
2022-11-15 17:09:51.456 Dean:    
2022-11-15 17:09:50.064 Dean:    just some thinking
2022-11-15 17:09:42.651 Dean:    later of course
2022-11-15 17:09:28.318 Dean:    I need to pick those up
2022-11-15 17:09:19.094 Dean:    the node widgets will be usable
2022-11-15 17:09:00.791 Dean:     and 11 on the laptop
2022-11-15 17:08:56.113 Dean:    sorry 10 on the desktop
2022-11-15 17:08:40.602 Dean:    now running Win11
2022-11-15 17:08:33.172 Dean:    on my new fast laptop and desktop
2022-11-15 17:08:20.503 Dean:    
2022-11-15 17:08:18.574 Dean:    but on your node widgets it might do well
2022-11-15 17:08:03.407 Dean:    probably not sensible with the YWE widgets
2022-11-15 17:07:45.114 Dean:    worth an investigation later
2022-11-15 17:07:36.067 Dean:    so it could be used
2022-11-15 17:07:27.782 Dean:    it transpiles ECMA 4 code
2022-11-15 17:07:19.629 Dean:    as the TS tool is backwardly compatible
2022-11-15 17:07:04.755 Dean:    Thinking about TypeScript and how/whether it could be applied to our widgets
2022-11-15 17:06:39.783 Dean:

2022-10-30 20:09:05.091 Dean:    I think on the faster system, the user programs are loading so quickly that perhaps GDI+ is not fully initialised?
2022-10-30 20:08:26.397 Dean:    I have found an entry in the system logs and it seems to point to an app crash caused by GDI+, the graphics framework
2022-10-30 20:07:28.056 Dean:    and I need logs

2022-10-28 14:47:45.658 Dean:    can you give me some practical guidance regarding unit testing?

2022-10-28 14:47:17.523 Dean:    
2022-10-28 14:47:08.628 Dean:    your implementation should give good results

2022-10-26 18:07:36.350 Dean:    FCW now starts automatically with Windows
2022-10-26 18:07:17.290 Dean:    nothing changes
2022-10-26 18:07:11.832 Dean:    <><>desktop01.png
2022-10-26 14:42:15.338 Dean:    I love them
2022-10-26 14:33:22.616 Dean:    I have a thing about magnets
2022-10-26 12:24:00.364 Dean:    similar config in all
2022-10-26 12:23:47.030 Dean:    regardless of o/s
2022-10-26 12:23:07.867 Dean:    all the other machines work well
2022-10-26 12:23:00.997 Dean:    the newest, fast machine is the culprit
2022-10-26 12:22:45.268 Dean:    the same may occur with fireCallWin
2022-10-26 12:22:29.049 Dean:    I have some debugging to do to find out why steamydock does not start when Windows starts on one machine only
2022-10-26 12:21:41.842 Dean:    to allow dropbox to do its thing
2022-10-26 12:21:30.579 Dean:    I might have to add a delay to the timers
2022-10-26 12:21:15.019 Dean:    added "run at startup" option
2022-10-26 12:21:01.866 Dean:    some small coding
2022-10-26 12:20:20.919 Dean:    all the panes...
2022-10-26 12:20:10.551 Dean:    and less boring
2022-10-26 12:20:04.275 Dean:    a slow and tedious job but it makes the painting so much easier
2022-10-26 12:19:45.553 Dean:    then taping all the window with masking tape
2022-10-26 12:19:32.583 Dean:    a little filling afterwards
2022-10-26 12:19:22.405 Dean:    sanding the window sashes on the downstairs bedroom window
2022-10-26 12:18:33.372 Dean:    worth pressing that button
2022-10-26 12:18:27.139 Dean:    you may find the rules are different now since that tower block disaster
2022-10-26 12:17:47.634 Dean:    you are quite correct
2022-10-26 10:01:25.458 Dean:    sounds as if there is a need for smoke detectors where the consumer units are
2022-10-26 10:01:05.100 Dean:    [quote] We all have two smoke/flame detectors in the flat, but there is no common system for the whole building. [/quote] 
2022-10-26 10:00:27.204 Dean:    all well?
2022-10-26 10:00:20.242 Dean:    How are you this morning?
2022-10-26 10:00:17.360 Dean:    Hello Harry!
2022-10-25 19:35:50.201 Dean:    good
2022-10-25 12:38:28.635 Dean:    was a fire alarm triggered?
2022-10-25 12:38:04.514 Dean:    not good
2022-10-25 11:03:49.334 Dean:    honestly, you don't need any more drama
2022-10-25 11:03:31.786 Dean:    could be wholesale replacements!
2022-10-25 11:03:16.747 Dean:    who is doing the investigation?
2022-10-25 11:02:58.220 Dean:    bus bar made of wrong material?
2022-10-25 11:02:42.088 Dean:    or a poor quality relay with some defect
2022-10-25 11:02:10.765 Dean:    yes
2022-10-25 10:57:37.112 Dean:    I'm guessing it was a faulty component
2022-10-25 10:56:59.358 Dean:    depending upon which safety feature they are currently focussing upon
2022-10-25 10:56:32.937 Dean:    previously they alternate between plastic and metal
2022-10-25 10:56:10.499 Dean:    the latest consumer units are all metal I understand
2022-10-25 10:55:51.395 Dean:    you need an inflatable tube, the type on a jet plane!
2022-10-25 10:53:45.944 Dean:    a pull on the rope raises it for the next
2022-10-25 10:53:26.370 Dean:    and it lowers you via a braking mechanism to the floor
2022-10-25 10:53:07.835 Dean:    you step out into the dark
2022-10-25 10:52:53.450 Dean:    place your foot in the loop
2022-10-25 10:52:44.126 Dean:    you throw it out the window
2022-10-25 10:52:14.898 Dean:    in the top floor
2022-10-25 10:52:06.130 Dean:    we also have a brake winch escape rope loop
2022-10-25 10:51:38.721 Dean:    we have!
2022-10-25 10:51:35.142 Dean:    do you have an emergency ropeladder?
2022-10-25 10:51:23.795 Dean:    you have smoke alarms
2022-10-25 10:50:20.975 Dean:    the consumer unit standards change evry 5years
2022-10-25 10:50:02.085 Dean:    oh dear
2022-10-25 10:28:37.625 Dean:    lovely here

2022-10-24 15:20:32.378 Dean:    will you postpone the family celebration for a few weeks?
2022-10-24 15:20:17.024 Dean:    [quote] Yes, fine. Lesley and Paul went home to Chester at 0900. [/quote] 
2022-10-24 15:20:03.577 Dean:    sounds like my life
2022-10-24 15:19:58.576 Dean:    [quote] Cleaned the loo's. Changed the sheets. Ran the washing machine. [/quote]

2022-10-23 20:35:47.618 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-10-23 20:35:44.955 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-10-23 20:35:42.528 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-10-23 18:38:10.052 Dean:    How is she?
2022-10-23 12:16:34.457 Dean:    
2022-10-23 12:16:33.718 Dean:    we'll see how it goes
2022-10-23 12:16:24.558 Dean:    
2022-10-23 12:16:22.298 Dean:    so, as I donate code and solutions I get paid
2022-10-23 12:16:04.642 Dean:    he understands my position here
2022-10-23 12:15:51.798 Dean:    
2022-10-23 12:15:46.324 Dean:    just a few hours as and when I want
2022-10-23 12:15:37.557 Dean:    so not too dissimilar from me
2022-10-23 12:15:22.656 Dean:    prior to that C#, VB.NET, and VB6 in that order going backward in time
2022-10-23 12:14:46.283 Dean:    he has only a year with .js
2022-10-23 12:14:35.065 Dean:    but the demonstration of all the javascript widgets and what they can do gave hime the confidence to ask me to help
2022-10-23 12:13:59.952 Dean:    he has as about as much knowledge as I
2022-10-23 12:13:41.959 Dean:    working with desktop frameworks
2022-10-23 12:13:27.919 Dean:    to help a friend of mine who is looking for someone with business experience who has knowledge of .js
2022-10-23 12:12:57.022 Dean:    I have the offer of some paid employment, part time
2022-10-23 12:12:43.119 Dean:    
2022-10-23 12:12:41.599 Dean:    but it is partly your fault!
2022-10-23 12:12:34.265 Dean:    hope you don't mind me telling you
2022-10-23 12:12:25.545 Dean:    in contrast, some good news for me...
2022-10-23 12:12:05.377 Dean:

2022-10-16 21:02:53.858 Dean:    that is the intention
2022-10-16 21:02:47.432 Dean:    
2022-10-16 21:02:45.560 Dean:    but not yet
2022-10-16 21:02:21.377 Dean:    Instead will add a separate battery pack (homemade by me) and a switch to operate the light
2022-10-16 21:01:51.860 Dean:    
2022-10-16 21:01:41.511 Dean:    but it won't operate from the control unit if juice is supplied to that terminal, unsure why not

2022-10-16 20:58:04.161 Dean:    and this is the rear tyre

2022-10-16 13:40:59.059 Dean:    the only way to refit is turn the bike upside down
2022-10-16 13:40:46.311 Dean:    Derailleur gears are a pain in the backside
2022-10-16 13:40:30.323 Dean:    not a job for faint-hearted

2022-10-15 18:46:11.346 Dean:    another in the garage
2022-10-15 18:46:00.915 Dean:    I have one just outside on a workmate bench
2022-10-15 18:45:48.558 Dean:    mine os tiny in comparison
2022-10-15 18:45:41.843 Dean:    that is quite a vice for indoors
2022-10-15 18:45:25.046 Dean:    and only then be content
2022-10-15 18:45:19.339 Dean:    you could probably convert your whole apartment into a workshop
2022-10-15 14:57:53.562 Dean:    for less than a tenner
2022-10-15 14:57:38.695 Dean:    very sturdy and no slack anywhere
2022-10-15 14:57:19.801 Dean:    and is a real vice
2022-10-15 14:57:14.584 Dean:    that takes up the same desk space
2022-10-15 14:56:59.847 Dean:    with a thick screw 1 1/4" jaws
2022-10-15 14:56:36.167 Dean:    replaced it with an original jeweller's vie, English made
2022-10-15 14:56:14.187 Dean:    it was more of a toy
2022-10-15 14:56:07.566 Dean:    not worth repairing though I have had it a long time
2022-10-15 14:55:49.057 Dean:    r
2022-10-15 14:55:47.278 Dean:    and the cast iton jaws cracked
2022-10-15 14:55:37.584 Dean:    I tightened it too much and too hard
2022-10-15 14:55:28.190 Dean:    to sum up it was more of a toy though it was still an operational vice
2022-10-15 14:55:02.228 Dean:    the screw wasn't up to the task
2022-10-15 14:54:44.471 Dean:    a replica of a large vice in look but rather puny in operation
2022-10-15 14:54:19.427 Dean:    jaws only about 3/4"
2022-10-15 14:54:02.976 Dean:    I had a miniature vice on the work bench
2022-10-15 14:53:34.920 Dean:

2022-10-15 13:01:43.702 Dean:    I tend to ignore spellcheckers as they invariably use American spelling but this one persisted int he corner of my as being wrong.
2022-10-15 13:00:57.699 Dean:    
2022-10-15 13:00:47.661 Dean:    legal meaning acceptable
2022-10-15 13:00:35.105 Dean:    It is a legal spelling supposedly, but just uncommon
2022-10-15 13:00:21.008 Dean:    Unsure as to why I added the i unless it is a thing I generally do.
2022-10-15 13:00:00.145 Dean:    I just wrote it out in a document and I used the former, it was highlighted as wrong. I could then not see why. The more I looked.

2022-10-14 11:32:33.893 Dean:    I think she was trying to kill me
2022-10-14 11:32:05.396 Dean:    To cure it, wife decided to send me outside in the cold and snow on a freezing train journey to the highlands to stay two weeks in a cold and damp country house by a deep loch where it rained for all the days we were there
2022-10-14 11:30:50.803 Dean:    and the two combined were taking me down
2022-10-14 11:30:33.514 Dean:    I had double pneumonia and I was told that I had picked up a viral infection that had settled in my lungs along with a bacterial infection
2022-10-14 11:29:52.632 Dean:    my lack of knowledge perhaps
2022-10-14 11:29:35.082 Dean:    I thought any virus that settled into the lungs was pneumonia
2022-10-14 11:29:11.848 Dean:    is there such a thing as a pneumonia jab?
2022-10-14 10:57:04.785 Dean:    did both covid and flu
2022-10-14 10:56:53.570 Dean:    inoculations today

2022-10-13 21:58:58.317 Dean:    that's annoying
2022-10-13 18:32:40.141 Dean:    time for a lawyer to get involved?
2022-10-13 18:32:30.087 Dean:

2022-10-13 18:30:58.916 Dean:    so I am rebuilding the hubs just in case
2022-10-13 18:30:38.662 Dean:    
2022-10-13 18:30:27.350 Dean:    as the distance between the dropouts (front forks) are different on old and new bikes

2022-10-13 18:28:49.058 Dean:    these probably haven't been greased for 35 years
2022-10-13 18:28:23.052 Dean:    On these bearing types the Grease should be checked yearly I found out
2022-10-13 18:27:55.067 Dean:    and it will be much, much better than before
2022-10-13 18:27:39.677 Dean:    I will insert new bearings packed with a lot of grease
2022-10-13 18:27:13.809 Dean:    end result is decent enough
2022-10-13 18:27:03.604 Dean:    an hour's work to remove all that with a drill and a wire brush
2022-10-13 18:26:33.733 Dean:    the hub, the shaft, the cones and the nuts were a ball of rust, bound by rust
2022-10-13 18:25:31.003 Dean:    new ball bearings ordered
2022-10-13 18:25:20.119 Dean:    very few were still round
2022-10-13 18:25:11.415 Dean:    the ball bearings fell out as they are uncaged

2022-10-11 13:50:50.345 Dean:    e
2022-10-11 13:50:47.866 Dean:    for onww
2022-10-11 13:50:44.760 Dean:    typing "rolson light hook" found the cheapest so far at 4.70
2022-10-11 13:50:08.050 Dean:    I think the reason they are going up in price is a combination of Brexit, Covid supply, general price increases and those 24LEDs are probably being phased out by the more powerful single LEDs
2022-10-11 13:49:11.299 Dean:    
2022-10-11 13:47:32.992 Dean:     for a bike lamp or similar they are superb replacements for the old 3v single filament pathetic lamps we used to have
2022-10-11 13:47:03.316 Dean:    but
2022-10-11 13:47:00.935 Dean:    I happen to have three small reflectors from some dead lamps that focus outward rather than in a tight beam
2022-10-11 13:46:23.743 Dean:    need a reflector and dissipator of some sort if using in a hurri lamp
2022-10-11 13:45:51.310 Dean:    The only problem with these is that they are a bit one-directional
2022-10-11 13:45:27.856 Dean:

2022-10-11 13:44:07.289 Dean:    
2022-10-11 13:42:09.987 Dean:    I snapped them up when I found them cheaply
2022-10-11 13:41:59.143 Dean:    a little more expensive than they used to be
2022-10-11 13:41:43.977 Dean:    cheapest found recently

2022-10-11 13:39:03.541 Dean:    yup
2022-10-11 13:37:07.066 Dean:    That one is my last unconverted

2022-10-11 13:36:30.443 Dean:    g
2022-10-11 13:36:28.358 Dean:    they stick to metal very strongly and hand up!
2022-10-11 13:36:09.791 Dean:    they are very useful lamps in themselves
2022-10-11 13:35:55.982 Dean:    I buy them in 6-7s when I find them for 2.50
2022-10-11 13:35:30.574 Dean:    or trimming to fit
2022-10-11 13:35:25.523 Dean:    either using glue to hold them in a larger mounting
2022-10-11 13:35:06.495 Dean:    and I find a way to shoe horn them in
2022-10-11 13:34:52.111 Dean:    the old reflectors and these modern lamps seem to be based upon a similar measurement
2022-10-11 13:34:19.054 Dean:    but so far always successful
2022-10-11 13:34:09.869 Dean:    some careful trimming is required
2022-10-11 13:33:56.722 Dean:    the diameter of the LED PCB is close to that used by all my lamps
2022-10-11 13:33:35.316 Dean:    all the work is done for me and the cost is ridiculously cheap

2022-10-11 13:31:11.300 Dean:    they come with a very strong neodymium magnet, a switch, body, PCB with LEDs mounted & battery box
2022-10-11 13:30:25.137 Dean:    the tent lamps are 2.50
2022-10-11 13:30:13.294 Dean:    I buy a hanging tent lamp, circular, then I extract the bits and repurpose
2022-10-11 13:29:35.477 Dean:    or
2022-10-11 13:29:33.798 Dean:    in the form of a line of LEDs with a battery pack already attached
2022-10-11 13:29:12.792 Dean:    typically, I buy a finished conversion kit
2022-10-11 13:23:58.025 Dean:    I have a few to try out
2022-10-11 13:23:51.910 Dean:    e
2022-10-11 13:23:49.980 Dean:    but a lid bas might do it
2022-10-11 13:23:30.892 Dean:    I might cut out more, the idea was originally to fit a box of a defined size but I found better battery/LED combination
2022-10-11 13:22:37.876 Dean:    it won't be in the damp anymore so it won't get any worse any time soon
2022-10-11 13:22:17.839 Dean:    I just converted it using Kurust, then painted it
2022-10-11 13:22:04.673 Dean:    I didn't remove it all, the base is thin metal.
2022-10-11 13:21:51.935 Dean:    see how rusty the base was
2022-10-11 13:21:41.423 Dean:    <><>310757415_1246873539428115_4543810084643197274_n.jpg
2022-10-11 13:20:51.290 Dean:    might be able to use a tube cap...
2022-10-11 13:20:36.977 Dean:    two sizes 130mm and 115mm
2022-10-11 13:18:46.641 Dean:    the switches were from old projects or dead devices
2022-10-11 13:18:31.322 Dean:    
2022-10-11 13:16:59.664 Dean:    one more to go
2022-10-11 13:16:47.142 Dean:    the originals had rotted through from the inside so these were never going to shine again with paraffin
2022-10-11 13:16:20.083 Dean:    I have cut the base of two of the tilley lamps to insert battery boxes
2022-10-11 13:15:52.311 Dean:    or similar
2022-10-11 13:15:48.712 Dean:    The bottom of the tilley is open I need to find a circular plastic lid of the right size to seal it
2022-10-11 13:15:01.879 Dean:    also derusted the body and repainted it
2022-10-11 13:14:50.912 Dean:    so no need to turn on the lights as you pass through
2022-10-11 13:14:37.797 Dean:    it will hang in the galley which is a bit of a corridor
2022-10-11 13:14:21.913 Dean:    
2022-10-11 13:14:20.308 Dean:    but I turn it off during the day
2022-10-11 13:14:10.964 Dean:    works for days
2022-10-11 13:14:04.562 Dean:    it broke off, glued the base back on, 2 x 1.5v D cells inside and a decent set of LEDs inside
2022-10-11 13:13:18.790 Dean:    cut off old oil filler drilled it out, did a grind on the rest, placed a switch in the resulting hole

2022-10-11 10:08:16.455 Dean:    with delay 
2022-10-11 10:08:04.684 Dean:    and each click is ponderous
2022-10-11 10:07:55.188 Dean:    they uprated their site with some new heavy framework
2022-10-11 10:07:40.940 Dean:    Deviantart is very slow these days
2022-10-11 10:05:55.274 Dean:    they are very good
2022-10-11 10:05:51.623 Dean:    then creates some of his own
2022-10-11 10:05:43.551 Dean:    he comes up with some renderings of real British planes

2022-10-11 09:25:33.988 Dean:    although I have a period item for that already
2022-10-11 09:25:20.490 Dean:    perhaps as a secondary back lamp on the old bike
2022-10-11 09:24:59.349 Dean:    It will go on one of the bikes
2022-10-11 09:24:17.198 Dean:    inside and out
2022-10-11 09:24:08.912 Dean:    rubbed it down, painted using a primer/converter then a good oil based paint
2022-10-11 09:23:32.732 Dean:    should be chrome silver but the chrome had rusted/peeled away, leaving good metal underneath
2022-10-11 09:23:04.434 Dean:    old Pifco brake lamp from the 70s derusted, repainted and converted to LED operation

2022-10-10 09:37:19.123 Dean:    unexpectedly
2022-10-10 09:37:14.935 Dean:    rained overnight
2022-10-10 09:36:59.968 Dean:    How are you this morning?
2022-10-10 09:36:58.043 Dean:    Hello Harry!
2022-10-09 21:08:04.631 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-10-09 21:08:00.392 Dean:    early to bed tonight
2022-10-09 21:07:49.141 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-10-09 21:05:47.346 Dean:    preparing for more to come
2022-10-09 21:05:32.848 Dean:    nothing interesting
2022-10-09 21:05:27.430 Dean:    and a tiny bit of coding too
2022-10-09 21:05:18.380 Dean:    some progress today
2022-10-09 21:05:13.726 Dean:    
2022-10-09 20:55:51.248 Dean:    and does the best job
2022-10-09 20:55:39.036 Dean:    always tests all my files
2022-10-09 20:55:30.810 Dean:    never had MwB fail on me
2022-10-09 18:25:59.873 Dean:    strange
2022-10-09 17:07:34.983 Dean:    rim is on the way
2022-10-09 17:07:26.899 Dean:    on my old 1930s/40s bike, removed rear wheel, cut all the spokes, trashed the rim (rotten) and extracted the Sturmey Archer hub, degreased and ready to refit to new rim/spokes
2022-10-09 17:06:27.752 Dean:    
2022-10-09 16:56:20.920 Dean:    took considerably longer
2022-10-09 16:56:09.419 Dean:    worth running Malwarebytes to compare
2022-10-09 11:51:39.069 Dean:    When I bought a MwB licence it was lifetime!
2022-10-09 11:51:14.078 Dean:    If Avast did not nag they might receive a donation
2022-10-09 11:50:42.316 Dean:    I do not have MwB running except when scan times arrived
2022-10-09 11:50:13.929 Dean:    might be fixed in later versions but it happened several times so I demoted MwB to second line operation
2022-10-09 11:49:27.344 Dean:    CPU usage can grow
2022-10-09 11:49:18.103 Dean:    malwarebytes, I have a liceence but MwB is often too invasive and affects normal usage
2022-10-09 11:48:46.008 Dean:    nags a bit too
2022-10-09 11:48:38.780 Dean:    Avast is still usable though growing and becoming more intrusive visually as time passes
2022-10-09 11:47:58.146 Dean:    On Windows I have always used Clamwin as the emergency backup scanner when I want very slimline operation and only scanning with some email integration
2022-10-09 11:43:26.612 Dean:    might be interesting to you
2022-10-09 11:43:19.333 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msWnY2zKS9o
2022-10-09 11:43:17.577 Dean:    
2022-10-09 11:43:07.951 Dean:    MwB found 7 items it felt were suspicious but they were just well-known hacking tools
2022-10-09 11:42:28.047 Dean:    
2022-10-09 11:42:18.779 Dean:    but it could be something else!
2022-10-09 11:42:04.116 Dean:    it could be vacuum tubes
2022-10-09 11:41:52.206 Dean:    and I void any nasty parts of the web - such as tubeEnhusiasts.com !
2022-10-09 11:41:26.681 Dean:    so, I feel safe-ish
2022-10-09 11:41:14.415 Dean:    I also have Virustotal installed and I check any downloads instantly
2022-10-09 11:40:42.974 Dean:    but Avast is slimmer in daily operation
2022-10-09 11:40:31.590 Dean:    I trust Malwarebytes to find more than Avast
2022-10-09 11:40:14.911 Dean:    I ran the Malwarebytes scan overnight
2022-10-09 10:49:14.673 Dean:    How is SWMBO?
2022-10-09 10:49:08.452 Dean:    just sometime you need a break...
2022-10-09 10:48:59.199 Dean:    I won't be doing it again
2022-10-09 10:48:52.981 Dean:    
2022-10-09 10:48:48.541 Dean:    so she is in a safe area and I felt confident just keep a half awake ear open
2022-10-09 10:48:18.090 Dean:    biologically if you get my gist
2022-10-09 10:48:04.013 Dean:    She was 'dealt' with last night
2022-10-09 10:47:45.368 Dean:    just tidies things repeatedly
2022-10-09 10:47:36.600 Dean:    does not get stressed
2022-10-09 10:47:28.410 Dean:    she had entered a much easier character to care for
2022-10-09 10:47:01.656 Dean:    we kept an eye out together
2022-10-09 10:46:54.489 Dean:    Mum was fine though
2022-10-09 10:46:47.550 Dean:    not good
2022-10-09 10:46:44.100 Dean:    latest ever

2022-10-08 19:39:19.166 Dean:    yearly thing
2022-10-08 19:39:12.065 Dean:    Avast followed my malwarebytes
2022-10-08 19:38:57.713 Dean:    running a full malware scan on main lappie here
2022-10-08 19:26:07.083 Dean:    slow day today
2022-10-08 14:52:57.407 Dean:    
2022-10-08 14:52:45.793 Dean:    a hard reboot
2022-10-08 14:52:36.050 Dean:    had to reboot as the laptop was getting a little slow
2022-10-08 14:52:20.229 Dean:    
2022-10-08 14:11:34.912 Dean:    that you use to work on items, then bring them back to the work bench
2022-10-08 14:11:10.591 Dean:    and a tool areas
2022-10-08 14:11:05.186 Dean:    you have an area you can work
2022-10-08 14:10:55.365 Dean:    much, much better
2022-10-08 11:53:17.218 Dean:    ha ha!

2022-10-07 18:58:13.953 Dean:    the sheet is the same size as the iphone more or less
2022-10-07 18:57:59.479 Dean:    the copper sheet is meant to dissipate heat from the GPU
2022-10-07 18:57:31.742 Dean:    the iphone can get quite hot when it is being charged at the same time as displaying videos full screen

2022-10-07 12:36:23.566 Dean:    I forgot you need to measure a rim not from rim to rim but you have to include the imaginary tyre
2022-10-07 12:35:51.572 Dean:    probably my fault
2022-10-07 12:35:46.641 Dean:    bought two new wheels for my bike but the rims delivered were the wrong size

2022-10-05 19:10:28.629 Dean:    then I will go round and do the top sashes, just the lower part below the panes

2022-10-04 17:38:18.413 Dean:    moving bike into garage just in case
2022-10-04 17:38:07.565 Dean:    
2022-10-04 16:32:25.268 Dean:    will try a scheduler entry and see how that goes, then I will need to disable the a/v tools and test that way
2022-10-04 16:31:57.551 Dean:    other programs there already all of which auto-start correctly
2022-10-04 16:31:38.226 Dean:    on the 'fast' desktop it will not auto-start even though the registry value is being written to the correct place
2022-10-04 16:31:05.265 Dean:    trying to find the reason for a bug in win10 64bit

2022-10-04 16:29:57.018 Dean:    
2022-10-04 16:29:55.944 Dean:    screwdrivers can be too destructive
2022-10-04 16:29:46.268 Dean:    I have thought about buying a spudger as so many seem to use them to open plastic clipped boxes
2022-10-04 16:29:09.511 Dean:    
2022-10-04 16:29:06.736 Dean:    ready for winter

2022-10-04 09:35:47.162 Dean:    metal spudger to open plastic devices that are clipped together
2022-10-03 21:34:37.780 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2022-10-03 21:24:13.997 Dean:    do you have a spudger?
2022-10-03 16:47:15.095 Dean:    I am so old now I forget my own birthday
2022-10-03 16:47:04.542 Dean:    don't worry
2022-10-03 16:44:55.644 Dean:    
2022-10-03 16:44:51.228 Dean:    My birthday two days ago, I forgot!
2022-10-03 16:44:41.036 Dean:    
2022-10-03 16:44:18.872 Dean:    I am sure someone, somewhere will emboss that on a leather wallet...
2022-10-03 16:44:02.407 Dean:    
2022-10-03 14:57:05.825 Dean:    and you could break her passwords in approx. 10 minutes of research...
2022-10-03 14:56:44.932 Dean:    my wife of course is the opposite
2022-10-03 14:56:28.965 Dean:    strange what we settle down to using
2022-10-03 14:56:18.629 Dean:    as I am so famliar with the elements
2022-10-03 14:55:54.678 Dean:    but very easy for me to type
2022-10-03 14:55:45.099 Dean:    and is several of those elements combined
2022-10-03 14:55:23.107 Dean:    my password for palemoon and firefox is 18 chars long
2022-10-03 14:54:49.741 Dean:    I have never disclosed it so much to anyone else before
2022-10-03 14:54:38.051 Dean:    but you'd have to know a lot about me and some very obscure stuff to figur out the logic
2022-10-03 14:54:11.232 Dean:    and not truly random
2022-10-03 14:54:04.444 Dean:    it isn't as mathematic
2022-10-03 14:53:57.996 Dean:    and return to
2022-10-03 14:53:51.620 Dean:    I have a sequence that I can reproduce
2022-10-03 14:53:38.590 Dean:    with those sources and their associated elements, a character and a date
2022-10-03 14:52:52.936 Dean:    and then possibly a date in some form
2022-10-03 14:52:41.678 Dean:    I combine those letters with spacers that are non alphanumeric
2022-10-03 14:52:10.096 Dean:    I take various letters from important elements of each (undefined elements but could be manuscripts or songs &c)
2022-10-03 14:51:28.011 Dean:    that for passwords involves a series of events/people/music/historical machines that have a set sequence and dates
2022-10-03 14:50:39.605 Dean:    my system is not so involved
2022-10-03 14:50:25.610 Dean:    or on the case of your smartphone
2022-10-03 14:50:01.562 Dean:    A nice wallet with the XOR tables embossed into the leather would be useful
2022-10-03 14:49:33.575 Dean:    or assume that a thief is not clever enough...
2022-10-03 14:49:14.323 Dean:    you have to keep the table away from the lost of PIN codes though
2022-10-03 14:48:59.465 Dean:    so as long as you have the table with you, you have access to the method to decode the pin numbers
2022-10-03 13:08:06.446 Dean:    how does that work?

2022-10-03 10:23:17.453 Dean:    all GUI and buxfix related

2022-10-01 18:55:29.930 Dean:    so it seems wise to prepare
2022-10-01 18:55:19.836 Dean:    Well, I'm expecting more soon
2022-10-01 16:37:01.995 Dean:    without being bothered by the rain
2022-10-01 16:36:47.991 Dean:    and then I can paint it as I wish
2022-10-01 16:36:29.081 Dean:    I have put up a polythene cover around one window so I can keep it dry after a day's sun
2022-10-01 16:35:57.724 Dean:    windy though

2022-09-30 19:37:04.751 Dean:    becoming cold
2022-09-30 19:22:18.582 Dean:    a chicken stir fry would be a welcome break
2022-09-30 19:22:01.250 Dean:    we have been eating them, microwaved since
2022-09-30 19:21:46.524 Dean:    froze them after they had cooled
2022-09-30 19:21:35.894 Dean:    we cooked using the oven on Monday last, trays of cottage pie x 2 + macroni cheese and a stew
2022-09-30 19:20:57.027 Dean:    sounds nice
2022-09-30 17:09:58.262 Dean:    raining here too

2022-09-29 21:34:08.227 Dean:    so it is time to pick it up again and teach him
2022-09-29 21:33:55.031 Dean:    now, he is
2022-09-29 21:33:51.679 Dean:    or rather that he wasn't that interested
2022-09-29 21:33:41.354 Dean:    but I could see he wan't quite ready
2022-09-29 21:33:30.965 Dean:    I made him aware of programming concepts over the last few years
2022-09-29 21:33:12.040 Dean:    and 
2022-09-29 21:33:10.260 Dean:    he already has some scripting under his belt
2022-09-29 21:32:59.604 Dean:    Just fifteen now
2022-09-29 21:10:28.230 Dean:    next steps
2022-09-29 21:10:21.869 Dean:    teaching my boy programming tomorrow afternoon
2022-09-29 21:09:59.808 Dean:    good progress today
2022-09-29 19:02:04.868 Dean:    always the way
2022-09-29 11:19:59.135 Dean:    but when you use a tool you determine its shortcomings or defects
2022-09-29 11:19:43.073 Dean:    a small change
2022-09-29 11:19:38.264 Dean:    but when it is not showing drag/drop is disabled
2022-09-29 11:19:22.730 Dean:    when the map is showing it makes sense to allow drag/drop
2022-09-29 11:19:02.831 Dean:    icon settings tool
2022-09-29 11:18:57.770 Dean:    just did some small coding

2022-09-29 09:50:18.970 Dean:    
2022-09-29 09:50:07.101 Dean:    and I suspect it will rain later
2022-09-29 09:49:56.628 Dean:    not warm

2022-09-25 18:12:04.664 Dean:    hopefully, they will be more efficient
2022-09-25 18:11:50.875 Dean:    that have been lighting the garage for years
2022-09-25 18:11:38.116 Dean:    bought two LED tubes to replace the 4ft neon tubes

2022-09-25 18:10:49.682 Dean:    
2022-09-25 18:10:48.282 Dean:    tidying the garage
2022-09-25 18:10:42.670 Dean:    
2022-09-25 16:38:11.311 Dean:    enough to feed us for a few days
2022-09-25 16:37:46.788 Dean:    making cottage pie tomorrow and macaroni cheese
2022-09-25 16:37:19.320 Dean:    how do you feel after the covid booster?
2022-09-25 16:37:08.474 Dean:    
2022-09-25 14:46:40.792 Dean:    it seems to help
2022-09-25 14:46:37.923 Dean:    just before I sleep
2022-09-25 14:46:32.325 Dean:    and I play and hour or so every two or three days
2022-09-25 14:46:15.195 Dean:    which I am a bit fond of
2022-09-25 14:45:53.425 Dean:    not that I play any except for mediaeval War II
2022-09-25 14:45:39.154 Dean:    that machine is perfect for games
2022-09-25 14:45:31.870 Dean:    installing Steam on the fast PC to see what it has to offer
2022-09-25 14:45:09.257 Dean:    
2022-09-25 14:44:38.032 Dean:    painting the interior window surround in my study in gloss white - stinky
2022-09-25 12:30:42.808 Dean:    
2022-09-25 12:30:34.728 Dean:    painting the old 1920s bike in gloss black on various items that I had not yet managed to get to
2022-09-25 12:30:02.536 Dean:    
2022-09-25 11:49:23.717 Dean:    until I can think of a concrete use or a new home is found
2022-09-25 11:49:00.506 Dean:    so, in a cupboard they go
2022-09-25 11:48:50.850 Dean:    not needed for testing anymore
2022-09-25 11:48:42.765 Dean:    they are kept as backup of data and o/s storage and as a quick replacement
2022-09-25 11:48:09.881 Dean:    asI move newer, better versions in, the older types slide out the bottom
2022-09-25 11:47:43.166 Dean:    I hjave too many computers here
2022-09-25 11:47:25.457 Dean:    
2022-09-25 11:47:23.216 Dean:    I quite like the effect
2022-09-25 11:47:05.696 Dean:    creates a riveted look
2022-09-25 11:46:57.321 Dean:    you screw a copper screw into a collar that holds the lead in place thenyou hammer a lead dot on top of the collar
2022-09-25 11:46:17.967 Dean:    worth looking at
2022-09-25 11:46:09.856 Dean:    lead dots
2022-09-25 11:46:06.245 Dean:    for securing lead to wood there are some fixings I have not come across before
2022-09-25 11:45:46.262 Dean:    
2022-09-25 11:45:30.716 Dean:    DamBusters, damn good film!
2022-09-25 11:45:13.011 Dean:    
2022-09-25 11:45:07.326 Dean:    I can use what I have elsewhere
2022-09-25 11:44:55.715 Dean:    so, looking to buy some wider lead sheeting
2022-09-25 11:44:40.285 Dean:    not happy to do that outside the window on the third floor with no scaffolding
2022-09-25 11:44:20.245 Dean:    I would have to layer the joint and weld with molten lead and a torch
2022-09-25 11:43:56.762 Dean:    the sheet I have is too short and will not do for the length/width of sill I have
2022-09-25 11:43:30.537 Dean:    researching how to fit lead sheet, not something I have done before, except for flashing
2022-09-25 11:43:08.633 Dean:    
2022-09-25 11:43:02.771 Dean:    like to see it in action
2022-09-25 11:42:47.598 Dean:    very clever
2022-09-24 19:40:15.007 Dean:    l
2022-09-24 19:40:12.396 Dean:    wil be fitting lead sheet to the window sill
2022-09-24 19:39:57.670 Dean:    painted a window today
2022-09-24 19:39:39.266 Dean:    cottage pie for mum, pre-cooked, for us it was bacon and egg sarnit with beans on the side
2022-09-24 19:38:58.692 Dean:    Mum is having her booster tomorrow afternoon
2022-09-23 21:15:46.387 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-09-23 21:15:42.151 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-09-23 21:15:34.666 Dean:    more work tomorrow
2022-09-23 21:15:20.425 Dean:    hard day
2022-09-23 21:15:15.917 Dean:    i'm off to bed now
2022-09-23 21:14:01.319 Dean:    very melo-dramatic
2022-09-23 21:13:48.953 Dean:    not bad
2022-09-23 21:13:40.291 Dean:    it was the 1992 film by Francis Ford Coppola
2022-09-23 21:12:47.102 Dean:    who is reading Frankenstein and Dracula
2022-09-23 21:12:29.295 Dean:    with my boy
2022-09-23 21:12:21.814 Dean:    just watched Dracula
2022-09-23 21:12:12.548 Dean:    
2022-09-23 18:27:48.807 Dean:    butI hear what you are saying
2022-09-23 18:27:39.695 Dean:    quite useful experience
2022-09-23 18:27:28.335 Dean:    it was really done to teach myself the methods and the possible issues. 
2022-09-23 18:13:55.146 Dean:    t
2022-09-23 18:13:52.650 Dean:    excuse typos
2022-09-23 18:13:46.977 Dean:    response is instand
2022-09-23 18:13:35.112 Dean:    with an SSD &c
2022-09-23 18:13:24.110 Dean:    I recently implemented an image cache on the iconSettings tool and I now realiuse that it is completely unneeded on such a fast PC
2022-09-23 18:12:15.735 Dean:    and it is just a 6th gen. Intel CPU
2022-09-23 18:12:04.990 Dean:    not just a 4ghz cpu but running so much more efficiently
2022-09-23 18:11:43.598 Dean:    it is SO very much quicker
2022-09-23 18:10:49.304 Dean:    but now, on the 'fast' PC I now have, I can run the clock with the pendulum running and it does not register any usage on the PC whatsoever
2022-09-23 18:10:02.407 Dean:    loved that machine
2022-09-23 18:09:53.805 Dean:    that was when I had an Acer 7720G core2duo 2.7ghz
2022-09-23 18:09:33.907 Dean:    the pendulum used 5-8% itself
2022-09-23 18:09:09.759 Dean:    Do you rememeber the CPU usage on the PCs we were using when developing my original widget, the clock with the pendulum?
2022-09-23 18:08:26.606 Dean:    
2022-09-23 18:08:24.868 Dean:    I'll watch that
2022-09-23 17:49:14.030 Dean:    and I was able to do some outside work
2022-09-23 17:49:05.091 Dean:    rain stopped
2022-09-23 17:49:01.341 Dean:    You were quite right

2022-09-21 15:06:32.747 Dean:    might take an hour
2022-09-21 15:06:19.982 Dean:    only some minor improvements, I use my tools and then I note UI improvements. I then implement them.

2022-09-20 19:35:20.238 Dean:    perhaps that is the reason

2022-09-20 19:34:51.957 Dean:    must be a special day

2022-09-20 10:24:55.830 Dean:    that sort of rubbish
2022-09-20 10:24:49.006 Dean:    "oh dear, your system has had a problem"
2022-09-20 10:24:20.194 Dean:    "getting your system ready"
2022-09-20 10:24:08.836 Dean:    and the way it 'talks'to me
2022-09-20 10:23:52.544 Dean:    if only I can forget all the Win10 'enhancements', the UI failure and the corporate bollox
2022-09-20 10:23:10.902 Dean:    but the new machine is a delight
2022-09-20 10:22:58.252 Dean:    something not right with it at all
2022-09-20 10:22:48.553 Dean:    my previous Win10 test box was an HP laptop crippled by hardware
2022-09-20 10:22:19.758 Dean:    I am able to test now on a Win10 bos with a reasonable sized screen and a decent CPU

2022-09-19 11:09:44.068 Dean:    no, I won't
2022-09-19 11:09:39.277 Dean:    [quote] Not that I'm recommending you do that!  Also not for me. [/quote] 
2022-09-18 19:19:45.180 Dean:    video of it in motion would be useful - don't cut your fingers off, not even one
2022-09-18 19:19:21.006 Dean:    understood
2022-09-18 19:19:17.225 Dean:    [quote] The short length of wood at the bottom of the image is a stop to prevent the jig from being pushed too far onto the bandsaw platform. [/quote] 
2022-09-18 19:18:03.793 Dean:    and I will not be able to install Win 11 on it (not that I want to)
2022-09-18 19:17:45.939 Dean:    That machine would last me 10 years
2022-09-18 19:17:20.223 Dean:    the motherboard is high spec

2022-09-10 12:06:05.617 Dean:    causing crashes in the IDE as it sets up interception paths with the o/s that aren't stopped when you exit abnormally in the IDE
2022-09-10 12:05:17.325 Dean:    I could probably sub class the whole form and intercept the click but subclassing is complex and nasty
2022-09-10 12:04:00.370 Dean:    yep
2022-09-10 11:59:45.110 Dean:    inelegant but...
2022-09-10 11:58:23.716 Dean:    
2022-09-10 11:58:22.147 Dean:    on its click event
2022-09-10 11:58:03.621 Dean:    that means that every control on the form needs to have one line added to set the opacity to 100% 
2022-09-10 11:57:24.206 Dean:    the controls intercept that click
2022-09-10 11:57:14.921 Dean:    under VB6 there is no method of intercepting a click on the whole form if there are child controls in the way
2022-09-10 11:56:40.728 Dean:    
2022-09-10 11:56:32.053 Dean:    or re-use the existing fade timer but stop to an set opacity level
2022-09-10 11:56:14.515 Dean:    at the moment it does an instant fade out, I might do that via another timer
2022-09-10 11:55:51.443 Dean:    
2022-09-10 11:55:46.212 Dean:    so I have tried to emulate that
2022-09-10 11:55:35.064 Dean:    a tool called Console had that functionality, it sat in the background at 5% opacity until you clicked upon the form when the form would spring back to 100% opacity
2022-09-10 11:54:42.831 Dean:    
2022-09-10 11:54:40.812 Dean:    and adding some functionality to allow minimisation not only to the desktop'stamp' but also to a pre-defined level of opacity
2022-09-10 11:53:47.375 Dean:    FCW VB6 rejigging the UI for the prefs and the main form as a trial swapping the polling lamps and minimise/close buttons
2022-09-10 11:50:01.070 Dean:    painted study window interior final gloss coat
2022-09-10 09:22:59.791 Dean:    send me some text please
2022-09-10 09:01:00.270 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1915
2022-09-10 08:57:01.081 Dean:    time should be correct now
2022-09-10 08:56:50.027 Dean:    changed the time service
2022-09-10 08:55:45.904 Dean:    Are you both well?
2022-09-10 08:55:42.686 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-09-10 08:55:41.704 Dean:    Hello!
2022-09-10 08:55:40.426 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-09-10 08:55:39.536 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-09-10 08:55:38.601 Dean:    Hello!
2022-09-10 08:55:37.197 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-09-10 01:25:08.877 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-09-09 23:07:11.012 Dean:    
2022-09-09 20:16:14.147 Dean:    I am testing things
2022-09-09 20:16:09.574 Dean:    forgive the attentions
2022-09-09 20:03:26.212 Dean:    <b><b>
2022-09-09 20:01:32.362 Dean:    <b><b>
2022-09-09 17:16:37.275 Dean:    and polishing things as I go
2022-09-09 17:16:23.546 Dean:    for SteamyDock
2022-09-09 17:16:14.333 Dean:    g
2022-09-09 17:16:11.461 Dean:    re: coding, I am goin through outstanding tasks and tidying up, then seeing what the bigger tasks need to complete
2022-09-09 17:15:13.334 Dean:    
2022-09-09 17:14:32.684 Dean:    just watched Charlie's speech
2022-09-09 17:14:25.169 Dean:    
2022-09-09 11:16:26.027 Dean:    lots of testing
2022-09-09 11:16:22.126 Dean:    to gain access to Windows programs
2022-09-09 11:16:11.093 Dean:    will test wine and Steam
2022-09-09 11:15:57.895 Dean:    no widgets and no VB6...
2022-09-09 11:15:42.504 Dean:    
2022-09-09 11:15:34.779 Dean:    given that so many of my tools are open source or have linux equivalents
2022-09-09 11:15:12.255 Dean:    but it is more win-like than I would expect
2022-09-09 11:14:54.652 Dean:    it will take some time to configure
2022-09-09 11:14:41.663 Dean:    in making a working environment
2022-09-09 11:14:31.615 Dean:    so, all in all good progress
2022-09-09 11:09:32.995 Dean:    and synching the browsers
2022-09-09 11:09:24.493 Dean:    next installing thunderbird
2022-09-09 11:08:47.170 Dean:    it was my preferred being simple and elegant
2022-09-09 11:08:35.118 Dean:    so I can't get that to operate
2022-09-09 11:08:27.908 Dean:    
2022-09-09 11:08:20.407 Dean:    but it is no longer supported and my not work anymore due to o/s changes to dependencies, the dev abandoned it when ubuntu changed its (failed) UIX
2022-09-09 11:07:32.137 Dean:    my default dock on linux was AWN Avant Window NAvigator
2022-09-09 11:07:15.557 Dean:    I realise Rocketdock's UI was well thought out
2022-09-09 11:06:43.095 Dean:    tried several docks, all unique and complicated and each has almost too much functionality
2022-09-09 11:06:13.514 Dean:    I will find a solution
2022-09-09 11:06:03.863 Dean:    so not good when selecting multiple icons, one by one
2022-09-09 11:05:47.259 Dean:    and Dolphin always forgets the folder path you last selected
2022-09-09 11:05:27.371 Dean:    so impossible to copy/paste the path (possibly is a way if you know how)
2022-09-09 11:05:00.038 Dean:    using Dolphin as the file explorer, the breadcrumbs/path is represented as icons rather than text
2022-09-09 11:04:21.730 Dean:    loaded Cairo dock with a little difficulty - configuration windows are so counter-intuitive
2022-09-09 11:03:51.677 Dean:    libre office as per windows
2022-09-09 11:03:35.858 Dean:    Gambas as a BASIC IDE
2022-09-09 11:03:14.777 Dean:    then palemoon, so I can synch that browser to match my Win7 lappie
2022-09-09 11:02:58.047 Dean:    freefilesync that is my default sync tool for windows
2022-09-09 11:02:40.068 Dean:    installed firefox, GIMP in place of photoshop
2022-09-09 11:02:21.132 Dean:    
2022-09-09 11:02:15.824 Dean:    my eldest
2022-09-09 11:02:12.590 Dean:    had to take advice from someone with more expertise (and time)
2022-09-09 11:01:54.690 Dean:    I formatted the 2TB but was unable to mount it due to some arcane issue with mounting as root
2022-09-09 11:01:20.417 Dean:    one or two issues
2022-09-09 11:01:11.550 Dean:    2TB as storage
2022-09-09 11:01:04.194 Dean:    SSD as boot drive
2022-09-09 11:00:57.810 Dean:    I have installed Kubuntu on the new desktop
2022-09-09 11:00:37.523 Dean:    because I can
2022-09-09 11:00:34.396 Dean:    up rather late
2022-09-09 11:00:28.940 Dean:    Morning!
2022-09-08 22:29:47.976 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-09-08 20:52:08.592 Dean:    lovely image
2022-09-08 20:51:56.337 Dean:    <><>elizabeth.jpg
2022-09-08 19:30:49.634 Dean:    very, very sad
2022-09-08 19:12:30.176 Dean:    Crikey, we live in turbulent times
2022-09-08 19:12:19.920 Dean:    
2022-09-08 17:54:38.402 Dean:    I ran straight in the kitchen and heard the announcement, they played the national anthem
2022-09-08 17:32:34.857 Dean:    expecting HM to expire within the next few days
2022-09-08 17:32:11.511 Dean:    
2022-09-08 15:13:19.933 Dean:    
2022-09-08 15:13:17.751 Dean:    and thank goodness for that
2022-09-08 15:13:08.837 Dean:    I backup religiously
2022-09-08 15:12:55.946 Dean:    I had to crash/hard reboot the laptop and the open VB6 project was unhappy about it
2022-09-08 15:12:28.884 Dean:    I think it failed to sleep properly
2022-09-08 15:12:11.834 Dean:    reason for crash? on one close/open of the laptop it failed to wake up properly
2022-09-08 15:11:29.750 Dean:    I only lost a very small amount of new code that was incomplete in any case
2022-09-08 15:11:10.682 Dean:    so two files were restored and all is largely back to as it was
2022-09-08 15:10:47.163 Dean:    However, I had backed up, just before leaving
2022-09-08 15:10:29.808 Dean:    I did have a corruption of my FCW project on my laptop that I took to Scotland
2022-09-08 10:46:57.569 Dean:    
2022-09-08 10:46:51.396 Dean:    so I got back in the swing of things too
2022-09-08 10:46:42.645 Dean:    on the train up and down, did some coding
2022-09-08 10:46:27.656 Dean:    so nice leading a normal life
2022-09-08 10:46:15.169 Dean:    mum is a committment
2022-09-08 10:46:10.049 Dean:    needed it very badly
2022-09-08 10:46:04.309 Dean:    but most of all a complete letting-go
2022-09-08 10:45:28.126 Dean:    
2022-09-08 10:45:22.688 Dean:    could not resist the clear water on a beautiful day
2022-09-08 10:45:08.728 Dean:    and went skinny dipping twice
2022-09-08 10:45:01.263 Dean:    walked and climbed
2022-09-08 10:44:48.844 Dean:    stayed up unto 5 one night just talking
2022-09-08 10:44:36.815 Dean:    eventful and relaxing
2022-09-08 10:44:26.746 Dean:    
2022-09-08 10:44:22.858 Dean:    that was during the ceremony
2022-09-08 10:44:14.179 Dean:    had to repair someone who slipped and fell and made two holes in his arms needing stitches
2022-09-08 10:43:47.324 Dean:    
2022-09-08 10:43:39.771 Dean:    held in a cave on a cliff overlooking the sea and the isles
2022-09-08 10:43:23.306 Dean:    the wedding of one of my best friends was emotional
2022-09-08 10:43:00.178 Dean:    unusual that you meet people so fascinating that it overwhelms you
2022-09-08 10:42:41.158 Dean:    Met some people that are many times more than interesting
2022-09-08 10:42:27.572 Dean:    
2022-09-08 10:41:56.346 Dean:    a lot warmer down South than it was in the North
2022-09-08 10:41:44.611 Dean:

2022-09-08 10:38:47.895 Dean:    my cat is so happy to see me he is chewing on my hands
2022-09-08 10:38:23.208 Dean:    seems like a long time
2022-09-08 10:37:15.451 Dean:    back

2022-09-01 21:52:32.051 Dean:    all in place
2022-09-01 21:52:25.320 Dean:    respite care for mum
2022-09-01 21:52:16.310 Dean:    but it has all come to pass
2022-09-01 21:52:09.377 Dean:    wasn't aware I was travelling
2022-09-01 21:52:00.578 Dean:    late to book
2022-09-01 20:23:48.332 Dean:    too interesting
2022-09-01 20:23:42.634 Dean:    if I arrived at your place I probably wouldn't leave
2022-09-01 20:23:18.639 Dean:    I think I am flying
2022-09-01 20:23:13.325 Dean:    but
2022-09-01 20:23:11.739 Dean:    and I'd take you up
2022-09-01 20:23:06.000 Dean:    I thankyou for that

2022-09-01 19:00:18.577 Dean:    just a visit to the Isle of Bute to visit a friend
2022-09-01 19:00:06.175 Dean:    nothing wrong
2022-09-01 19:00:02.209 Dean:    assume I will be offline for a while
2022-09-01 18:59:53.930 Dean:    I may take the laptop with me, I am unsure
2022-09-01 18:59:44.775 Dean:    Harry, I will be in Scotland for a few days
2022-09-01 18:59:33.211 Dean:    
2022-09-01 12:11:50.888 Dean:    Back shortly, I'm off out.
2022-09-01 11:15:15.660 Dean:    Dropbox has died twice in three days
2022-09-01 11:14:01.545 Dean:    When the alarm sounds I am going to put up a msgbox that gives you the option of killing the dropbox processes and restarting dropbox
2022-09-01 09:59:42.011 Dean:    Dropbox died
2022-09-01 09:52:31.855 Dean:    whilst I am doing other things
2022-09-01 09:52:23.331 Dean:    but- step by step
2022-09-01 09:52:17.679 Dean:    a slow and inefficient method
2022-09-01 09:51:59.514 Dean:    de-rusting, primin and painting a specific area
2022-09-01 09:51:44.980 Dean:    I am doing ten minutes on it now and then
2022-09-01 09:51:31.702 Dean:    photos when complete
2022-09-01 09:51:20.641 Dean:    y
2022-09-01 09:51:18.652 Dean:    but as it is a family heirloom I feel the need to care for it every ten years
2022-09-01 09:51:02.525 Dean:    it is a ladies bike
2022-09-01 09:50:46.657 Dean:    it has a 1960s childseat
2022-09-01 09:50:34.394 Dean:    but the rest of the bike is really good
2022-09-01 09:50:24.900 Dean:    as the rim has rotted at a join
2022-09-01 09:50:10.878 Dean:    I have to replace the rear wheel
2022-09-01 09:50:01.372 Dean:    still has the white strip painted on the rear mudguard
2022-09-01 09:49:45.571 Dean:    been in the family since the war

2022-08-31 19:04:30.425 Dean:    a powerful man
2022-08-31 19:03:33.507 Dean:    probably compulsory due to a donation once upon a time
2022-08-31 19:03:08.955 Dean:    amazing that they are still giving a Service of Thanksgiving to an Elizabethan Statesman
2022-08-31 19:01:13.168 Dean:    y
2022-08-31 19:01:03.673 Dean:    lots of painting, puttying, drilling, priming, scraping, washing. druing, caring, phoning today
2022-08-31 19:00:32.388 Dean:

2022-08-30 20:06:12.144 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2022-08-30 20:05:56.765 Dean:    ha ha!
2022-08-30 20:05:53.598 Dean:    [quote] I'm getting plenty of exercise! [/quote] 
2022-08-30 19:53:11.662 Dean:    when did you last cycle?
2022-08-30 19:53:00.841 Dean:    I only cycle side roads
2022-08-30 19:52:49.501 Dean:    to reduce range anxiety
2022-08-30 19:52:40.772 Dean:    range with all electric vehicles is something to experiment with
2022-08-30 19:52:27.139 Dean:    
2022-08-30 19:52:24.727 Dean:    I don't even notice them with the ebike
2022-08-30 19:52:11.907 Dean:    sweat is produced in large amounts
2022-08-30 19:52:00.578 Dean:    but when you move to a non-assisted bike you soon realise how many hills there are here
2022-08-30 19:51:36.941 Dean:    we have few hills here and I avoid the longer uphill rides
2022-08-30 19:51:13.244 Dean:    or less on a mountain climb!
2022-08-30 19:50:54.692 Dean:    but a lot of uphill assistance might reduce the range to 5-7 miles or so
2022-08-30 19:50:24.223 Dean:    in effect
2022-08-30 19:50:19.963 Dean:    on hills, it reduces the steepness by 75%
2022-08-30 19:50:01.019 Dean:    leading to high top speeds
2022-08-30 19:49:52.686 Dean:    it is only a 350w motor but the assistance on flat roads is incremental
2022-08-30 19:49:29.756 Dean:    but the steepness of all hills are significantly reduced by the assistance
2022-08-30 19:49:04.166 Dean:    it would shorten the range for sure
2022-08-30 18:51:58.125 Dean:    in Kherson
2022-08-30 18:51:53.721 Dean:    Ukraine's counter attack

2022-08-30 17:33:48.474 Dean:    cycled faster with a higher battery load to see how well the batteries cope
2022-08-30 17:33:21.854 Dean:    almost
2022-08-30 17:33:19.185 Dean:    cycled to coast
2022-08-30 17:33:14.105 Dean:    back again

2022-08-30 09:21:00.335 Dean:    Hello!
2022-08-30 09:20:59.448 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-08-30 09:20:57.961 Dean:    Hello!
2022-08-29 19:29:58.966 Dean:    Just going out for a while, back later!
2022-08-29 13:12:12.949 Dean:    the tanks can hold all that fuel without degradation?
2022-08-29 13:11:56.878 Dean:    assuming they won't have to disassemble?
2022-08-29 13:11:39.182 Dean:    handling all that fuel is an appalling prospect
2022-08-29 13:11:22.516 Dean:    can't have a US failure at this point in the world's history
2022-08-29 13:10:49.221 Dean:    then built five more until one made it
2022-08-29 13:10:28.984 Dean:    just Americans being extra careful, Russians would have launched!
2022-08-29 13:08:54.547 Dean:    yes, just found it
2022-08-29 13:08:42.153 Dean:    didn't see that anywhere
2022-08-29 13:07:26.413 Dean:    what makes you say that?

2022-08-29 13:00:42.531 Dean:    
2022-08-29 13:00:25.761 Dean:    but the end result is quite good
2022-08-29 13:00:13.864 Dean:    not an easy method
2022-08-29 13:00:04.110 Dean:    attaching using superglue
2022-08-29 12:59:45.799 Dean:    using brass sheet to replace items on that Tiger tank model that should be a lot thinner than the kit supplied items, mudguards &c
2022-08-29 12:58:50.273 Dean:    surprising how strong even a soft metal like brass is
2022-08-29 12:58:35.431 Dean:    seems very thin indeed from the description but it is rather hard to work with, requiring tin snips or sharp small scissors with good leverage
2022-08-29 12:57:45.916 Dean:    0.01 mm thick
2022-08-29 12:51:59.754 Dean:    working with thin brass sheet

2022-08-29 10:22:01.390 Dean:    Rickard has just released MPad and is coming up with new releases/fixes almost immediately any bugs are raised
2022-08-29 10:21:11.004 Dean:    and the VB6 IDE is for VB
2022-08-29 10:20:56.521 Dean:    RJtextEd is my main editor for opening .js projects
2022-08-29 10:20:28.157 Dean:    I use Context as my default notepad replacement
2022-08-29 10:20:12.753 Dean:    it operates just as Context used to
2022-08-29 10:20:00.507 Dean:    Rickard has created a cut-down version of RJTextEd that opens and runs very quickly indeed

2022-08-29 10:17:33.718 Dean:    but if we had continuous Apollo development over the last fifty years, we would have had Artemis as the booster stage...
2022-08-29 10:16:41.113 Dean:    Well, so it ought to be given 50 years
2022-08-29 10:16:25.568 Dean:    [quote] It is claimed that the new rocket is very much more advanced. [/quote] 
2022-08-29 09:35:40.154 Dean:    We've just arrived back at the same level of space technology that we had in 1972

2022-08-28 11:04:55.783 Dean:    and we understand oses so it should be a do-able experience
2022-08-28 11:04:34.130 Dean:    So, we have some familiarity
2022-08-28 10:33:37.557 Dean:    old dog/new tricks &c
2022-08-28 10:33:26.666 Dean:    then it is harder to shake the Windows mindset
2022-08-28 10:33:11.527 Dean:    when you have the same apps and utilities that you are familiar with in Windows
2022-08-28 10:32:50.843 Dean:    
2022-08-28 10:32:34.931 Dean:    and the unix abstracts always give me the wobbles
2022-08-28 10:32:10.392 Dean:    Both VMS and DOS/Win all use hard drives as the file system reference
2022-08-28 10:31:40.680 Dean:    it takes me a while to get my head around it
2022-08-28 10:31:26.482 Dean:    the only thing that consistently stymies me is the file system and mounting points/aliases &c
2022-08-28 10:30:48.860 Dean:    so I have familiarity
2022-08-28 10:30:40.965 Dean:    and parsed the relevant switches for conversion to the native system qualifiers
2022-08-28 10:30:14.849 Dean:    so I can use unix command line utilities and call up the respective DOS/VMS utilities
2022-08-28 10:29:40.639 Dean:    on top of that in the 80s/90s I configured PCs and VMS to duplicate the basic unix command sets
2022-08-28 10:28:57.789 Dean:    and I have had installations of Slax, Mint and Kubuntu on various laptops over the years
2022-08-28 10:27:54.632 Dean:    not consistently
2022-08-28 10:27:50.113 Dean:    luckily I have been using variants of Unix on/off since 1985
2022-08-28 10:27:20.955 Dean:    could be useful
2022-08-28 10:21:54.472 Dean:    no hurries
2022-08-28 10:21:50.868 Dean:    until I manage to coerce it to a working environment
2022-08-28 10:21:32.539 Dean:    configuring and finding replacement apps
2022-08-28 10:21:17.416 Dean:    getting used to it
2022-08-28 10:21:11.466 Dean:    it will be an occasional use system
2022-08-28 10:21:01.937 Dean:    I don't want it to distract
2022-08-28 10:20:48.379 Dean:    and then setting it up in  particular room away from my study
2022-08-28 10:20:26.424 Dean:    just mounting the hard drives properly, they are flapping about at the moment
2022-08-28 10:19:02.155 Dean:    Kubuntu installed and running, applications configured

2022-08-27 14:01:17.793 Dean:    so, for me it is an upgrade
2022-08-27 14:01:08.489 Dean:    it is the most powerful PC I own!
2022-08-27 14:00:59.503 Dean:    built using other's cast offs or items bought very cheaply

2022-08-27 13:59:12.587 Dean:    but I doubt I will
2022-08-27 13:59:07.412 Dean:    I might also have a separate boot drive if I ever want to install Windows on the hardware
2022-08-27 13:58:26.291 Dean:    and configuring VMs is the next task

2022-08-17 13:46:01.501 Dean:    I have such a switch but I have lost the collar
2022-08-17 13:45:35.498 Dean:    needs a rotary switch to attach to the knob at the top that is currently floating

2022-08-16 20:29:55.358 Dean:    a quick measurement externally shows the battery box is quite a lot larger, an inch of extra in all dimensions
2022-08-16 20:29:15.598 Dean:    if I can find those batteries then I am sure I can find the correct size with similar properties
2022-08-16 20:28:12.161 Dean:    so any improvement will be a benefit
2022-08-16 20:27:56.790 Dean:    the current batteries are standard lead acid and the total amperage will be much less
2022-08-16 20:27:13.078 Dean:    but the concept is sound
2022-08-16 20:27:05.791 Dean:    I'm not sure if they would fit in as I have not yet checked the physical size

2022-08-16 17:19:31.292 Dean:    quite a good price
2022-08-16 16:07:45.471 Dean:    so, it may be time to replace
2022-08-16 16:07:34.816 Dean:    the price is really falling over the period I have been watching them

2022-08-16 16:06:42.414 Dean:    each one is 7.2a giving 21a and each will be much lighter
2022-08-16 16:06:15.144 Dean:    it is time to change those to 3 x lipo 12v batteries with more charge cycles
2022-08-16 16:05:48.729 Dean:    and inside are 3 x 12v lead acid batteries in series
2022-08-16 16:05:29.702 Dean:    it has a 1.5ft long battery pack
2022-08-16 16:05:13.676 Dean:    and it has a 36v battery pwoering a front hub motor
2022-08-16 16:04:59.926 Dean:    in the garage for three years
2022-08-16 16:04:47.722 Dean:    I have an old ebike
2022-08-16 13:41:33.790 Dean:    the lead acid types I mean, small format
2022-08-16 13:41:04.459 Dean:    how much were they?
2022-08-16 13:40:59.564 Dean:    those 12v batteries you bought
2022-08-16 13:40:48.534 Dean:    
2022-08-16 08:45:01.912 Dean:     Windspeed is 1 knots, force 1, direction N

2022-08-16 08:44:49.286 Dean:    Morning!
2022-08-16 08:44:47.558 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-08-16 08:44:46.583 Dean:    Hello!
2022-08-15 21:08:00.976 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-08-15 21:07:37.663 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-08-15 21:07:36.127 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-08-15 20:42:00.550 Dean:    not yet needed it really but having it removes the range anxiety
2022-08-15 20:41:30.781 Dean:    at the moment I have a 15amp in the frame and another 13amp in the pannier ready for a quick swap
2022-08-15 20:40:55.029 Dean:    I will wait until the technology improves and the currently high capacity batteries come down in price
2022-08-15 20:40:18.801 Dean:    If my bike was 30amp it would be a dream
2022-08-15 20:40:01.509 Dean:    50 in a pack and it soon starts to add up, then the build costs on top and top of the range BMS
2022-08-15 20:39:30.256 Dean:    might be close to 500 for a compact version as each battery is 6-7 GBP
2022-08-15 20:38:50.362 Dean:    30 amp custom build is 400 gbp
2022-08-15 20:38:27.441 Dean:    a 30amp battery is do-able but would be large and bulky or compact and very expensive
2022-08-15 20:37:42.957 Dean:    you could do the same speed without any legs but you'd be lucky to get 1/3rd of the way before the battery died
2022-08-15 20:36:53.019 Dean:    each with legs
2022-08-15 20:36:47.087 Dean:    level 3 is 15-18mph consistently
2022-08-15 20:36:29.268 Dean:    2 is a mere 12mph-14mph
2022-08-15 20:36:11.370 Dean:    top level takes you to 25mph with your legs too
2022-08-15 20:35:48.419 Dean:    There are five levels
2022-08-15 20:35:40.176 Dean:    and it took me there and back at level 2 there and level 3 back
2022-08-15 20:35:21.554 Dean:    the battery is a 15amp battery
2022-08-15 20:35:11.480 Dean:    [quote] So 40 miles on a single battery? [/quote] 
2022-08-15 20:34:37.873 Dean:    do you have a cobbler near you?
2022-08-15 20:34:28.888 Dean:    mending shoes these days is expensive!
2022-08-15 20:34:19.301 Dean:    took my shoes to the menders
2022-08-15 20:34:02.920 Dean:    sanded down another shelf on my pigeon holes for my study, two more to go
2022-08-15 20:33:36.591 Dean:    swept the garage work area of shavings and detritis
2022-08-15 20:33:20.273 Dean:    worked on my bike lamp conversions and repaints
2022-08-15 20:33:02.156 Dean:    did well today
2022-08-15 20:32:58.688 Dean:    
2022-08-15 20:32:46.456 Dean:    lovely
2022-08-15 14:32:09.664 Dean:    If you are careful
2022-08-15 14:30:50.915 Dean:    but I cycle the back roads so another 5-7 on top of that
2022-08-15 14:30:27.405 Dean:    15 miles as the crow flies
2022-08-15 14:30:20.707 Dean:    [quote] How far to the coast and back? [/quote] 
2022-08-15 13:23:30.019 Dean:    without battery it is like pedalling a small landrover
2022-08-15 13:22:56.691 Dean:    battery died just as I reached home
2022-08-15 13:22:26.110 Dean:    cycled to coast
2022-08-15 08:32:37.344 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.

2022-08-14 22:06:24.072 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-08-14 20:39:45.646 Dean:    too big to turn on the lathe
2022-08-14 18:09:00.312 Dean:    now needs to dry and repaint
2022-08-14 18:08:51.985 Dean:    just puttied the interior
2022-08-14 18:08:42.748 Dean:    added new putty after raking out the study window exterior
2022-08-14 17:08:48.149 Dean:    doing well here

2022-08-13 17:37:59.790 Dean:    pigeon hole type
2022-08-13 17:37:51.155 Dean:    sanding down some old shelves

2022-08-13 15:01:25.350 Dean:    [quote] I managed to break the wooden end of the tiller arm off - have removed the remains from the tube - drilled it out then push it from the other end with the broom handle. [/quote] 
2022-08-13 14:56:53.035 Dean:    like new
2022-08-13 14:56:49.336 Dean:    perfect condition

2022-08-13 14:55:03.018 Dean:    lovely day!

2022-08-13 14:53:30.617 Dean:    I went outside to paint something and quickly swooned 
2022-08-13 14:53:14.348 Dean:    it is too hot outside
2022-08-13 14:49:16.031 Dean:    with only one battery swap out
2022-08-13 14:49:07.692 Dean:    cycled to the coast and back carrying the spare battery in the panniers, meaning that I can cycle 45-60 miles in one trip
2022-08-13 14:48:23.519 Dean:    it has been tested on the ebike
2022-08-13 14:48:04.180 Dean:    changed the box, the connectors, added inline fuses x 2, properly potted and now tested
2022-08-13 14:47:29.767 Dean:    a conversion from one battery type to another
2022-08-13 14:47:15.001 Dean:    a 15amp device
2022-08-13 14:47:02.102 Dean:    I finished one of my bike batteries
2022-08-13 14:46:45.579 Dean:    
2022-08-13 14:46:40.885 Dean:    I quite forgot to test that cap.
2022-08-13 14:46:29.756 Dean:    
2022-08-13 14:45:46.418 Dean:    without any potential for drain
2022-08-13 14:45:37.897 Dean:    so I can keep the 9v battery attached
2022-08-13 14:45:23.884 Dean:    I just added a small on/off switch
2022-08-13 14:45:08.773 Dean:    <><>298361547_5366254896794262_1848679865055188135_n.jpg

2022-08-13 13:37:00.458 Dean:    I am going to geess that it was from a washing machine
2022-08-13 13:11:26.644 Dean:    could not identify the part no.
2022-08-13 13:11:13.883 Dean:    I think you may be right but I've never encountered one like that before
2022-08-13 13:10:55.852 Dean:    [quote] Perhaps a noise suppression capacitor for a motor.   Or a capacitor from an induction motor. [/quote] 
2022-08-13 13:10:48.224 Dean:    and replacing with matching alternatives that are more efficient
2022-08-13 13:10:27.848 Dean:    I feel no guilt ripping out the internal connectors
2022-08-13 13:10:10.420 Dean:    without an upgrade
2022-08-13 13:10:06.108 Dean:    so these old lamps are virtually useless now
2022-08-13 13:09:51.708 Dean:    the two batteries were joined by a copper strip with a sprung top
2022-08-13 13:09:25.001 Dean:    these old lamps use an original battery format that no longer exists
2022-08-13 13:08:35.859 Dean:    another couple of coats to go

2022-08-13 13:05:20.622 Dean:    I cannot remember
2022-08-13 13:05:01.756 Dean:    it is probably the missing part from your lift
2022-08-13 13:04:46.456 Dean:    I salvaged it but I forgot to mark what it was from
2022-08-13 13:03:33.123 Dean:    but it sits on the back of a power connector so it appears to be a strange can cap.
2022-08-13 13:02:59.744 Dean:    and it looks like a temp sensor
2022-08-13 13:02:45.742 Dean:    I salvaged it a while ago

2022-08-01 09:10:35.081 Dean:    one way or another
2022-08-01 09:10:28.310 Dean:    and causing a continuous movement
2022-08-01 09:10:14.192 Dean:    they drag to the right or left at every touch as if they have something on the pad that is sticking to it
2022-08-01 09:09:44.131 Dean:    they all seem to go the same way in the end
2022-08-01 09:09:33.617 Dean:    Bloody Dell e6410 is having a problem with its touchpad
2022-07-31 17:24:47.314 Dean:    no lift engineers, then they all come at once
2022-07-31 17:22:25.657 Dean:    just when you need it
2022-07-31 17:22:20.408 Dean:    that is typical

2022-07-31 17:20:25.943 Dean:    tidying up my study as we go
2022-07-31 17:19:31.716 Dean:    awaiting arrival of an inline fuse to complete
2022-07-31 17:19:05.292 Dean:    I need to remind myself to thread the shrink wrapping in advance!
2022-07-31 17:18:46.537 Dean:    shrink wrapping as I go
2022-07-31 17:18:35.732 Dean:    on the ebike battery
2022-07-31 17:18:29.523 Dean:    soldering the neutral wire to the connector, and the battery monitor board to the same port
2022-07-31 11:10:41.998 Dean:    I understand
2022-07-31 10:43:54.082 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-07-31 10:43:53.085 Dean:    Hello!
2022-07-30 16:47:26.439 Dean:    unless it is with regard to the Falklands or the British role in WWII
2022-07-30 16:46:54.809 Dean:    I don't often quote Quora
2022-07-30 16:46:44.640 Dean:    if you can send me the link
2022-07-30 16:44:08.111 Dean:    love to see that text in the original form
2022-07-30 16:43:47.811 Dean:    n
2022-07-30 16:43:46.108 Dean:    Yes, well, some of that is blindingly obvious and I've always been surprised how small mided SNP supporters can be
2022-07-30 16:03:42.690 Dean:    but stil some
2022-07-30 16:03:39.471 Dean:    so not as far to walk
2022-07-30 16:03:01.240 Dean:    blimey!
2022-07-30 16:02:54.702 Dean:    
2022-07-30 12:00:34.671 Dean:    will drain and test shortly
2022-07-30 12:00:23.371 Dean:    worth extracting and saving
2022-07-30 12:00:14.642 Dean:    the two 18650s are newish and 3350mAh
2022-07-30 11:59:58.788 Dean:    I salvaged two 18650s from a battery extra charge pack that would no longer function, (dead board)
2022-07-30 11:59:00.596 Dean:    rained here too but I managed to save the washing
2022-07-30 10:05:27.331 Dean:    reboot
2022-07-30 10:05:23.002 Dean:    had to rebbot as my Dell would not wake up from a sleep
2022-07-30 10:05:11.080 Dean:

2022-07-30 10:05:08.229 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-07-29 22:58:10.608 Dean:    and I am adding fuses at the same time
2022-07-29 22:58:02.040 Dean:    and all the wires need to be cut/desoldered and remade
2022-07-29 22:57:45.182 Dean:    the battery structure (lattice) required some cutting and sawing
2022-07-29 22:57:07.536 Dean:    transferring a 15amp battery from an enclosure with an incorrect connector to a new enclosure with the correct type
2022-07-29 22:56:14.901 Dean:    working on a second ebike battery
2022-07-29 22:56:03.396 Dean:    
2022-07-29 15:39:08.410 Dean:    the train section is completely gone
2022-07-29 15:38:58.381 Dean:    lots seem to have been removed
2022-07-29 15:38:50.466 Dean:    I loved all the working Victorian replica models  in cases with electric and manually turned handles
2022-07-29 15:38:17.374 Dean:    not quite as good as it used to be
2022-07-29 15:38:09.370 Dean:    I love it there
2022-07-29 14:18:23.156 Dean:    all re-soldered, refitted, tested with 40 amp fuse - all good
2022-07-29 14:18:04.092 Dean:    re: my ebike battery
2022-07-29 14:17:35.577 Dean:    in Kensington?
2022-07-29 14:17:29.620 Dean:    when was the last time you went to the Science Museum?
2022-07-29 14:16:57.184 Dean:    the Rocket, I mean
2022-07-29 14:16:49.379 Dean:    Yup, I previously watched similar
2022-07-29 08:39:41.969 Dean:     Windspeed is 5 knots, force 2, direction NNE
2022-07-29 08:39:41.969 Dean:     Partly cloudy at 1400 ft.

2022-07-29 08:19:39.730 Dean:    of course it is Stephenson's Rocket that is at the science museum
2022-07-29 08:19:22.412 Dean:    
2022-07-29 08:16:38.391 Dean:    
2022-07-29 08:15:29.623 Dean:    so a little flux and a new soldered joint to fix and we should be back to normal
2022-07-29 08:14:56.784 Dean:    that the other battery does not do
2022-07-29 08:14:44.047 Dean:    that explained the occasional cut-outs
2022-07-29 08:14:30.077 Dean:    and the wire was held in place by a shrink wrap and the potting compoiund
2022-07-29 08:14:07.531 Dean:    the joint was only held by a mechanical push of the wire with a blob of solder helping it to fill the lug it was supposet to be soldered to
2022-07-29 08:13:21.328 Dean:    turns out it was a dry joint on the original soldering of the power line to the output connector
2022-07-29 08:12:55.932 Dean:    my ebike battery was not functioning after my fitting of fuses and new switch
2022-07-29 08:12:13.767 Dean:    Morning!
2022-07-28 17:55:53.749 Dean:    
2022-07-28 17:55:49.759 Dean:    I just have to resolve a mismatch between the array number and the listbox number
2022-07-28 18:31:09.618 Dean:    testing
2022-07-28 17:55:19.686 Dean:    the editing is almost working
2022-07-28 17:41:20.457 Dean:    on the bike
2022-07-28 17:41:16.509 Dean:    on my ebike battery I have added two fuses  and am about to test the latest fuse
2022-07-28 17:40:49.648 Dean:    
2022-07-28 17:40:47.115 Dean:    I will resolve whatever it screws up
2022-07-28 17:40:37.119 Dean:    I am going to be doing some testing of FCW editing lines, it may mess stuff up from time to time
2022-07-28 17:36:26.353 Dean:    I have seen that loco at the Science Museum
2022-07-28 17:35:57.178 Dean:    I like a trebuchet
2022-07-28 13:42:10.096 Dean:    ?
2022-07-28 13:42:07.981 Dean:    to any point in particular
2022-07-28 13:41:54.181 Dean:    let's hope it stays fine for you
2022-07-28 13:41:42.284 Dean:    good weather for it
2022-07-28 09:32:10.813 Dean:     Windspeed is 12 knots, force 4, direction E

2022-07-28 09:32:01.943 Dean:    
2022-07-28 09:31:32.349 Dean:    very useful
2022-07-28 09:31:27.263 Dean:    Thanks for that
2022-07-27 22:44:58.558 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-07-27 22:44:51.293 Dean:    thankyou
2022-07-27 22:14:14.172 Dean:    not the grey stuff which is hot glue
2022-07-27 22:14:03.691 Dean:    the white stuff

2022-07-27 22:13:34.677 Dean:    Actually we have two pictures already in the exchange folder
2022-07-27 22:12:18.161 Dean:    wilco
2022-07-27 22:06:57.053 Dean:    some coding achieved on the logic to edit text
2022-07-27 22:00:33.250 Dean:    I suppose I need to do some research on battery self-building forums
2022-07-27 22:00:04.449 Dean:    I have some acetone
2022-07-27 21:59:50.288 Dean:    but it returns too many products for proper hard potting
2022-07-27 21:59:22.292 Dean:    I have searched for potting compound
2022-07-27 21:59:13.656 Dean:    it would be very useful to know what it is
2022-07-27 21:59:02.945 Dean:    I will try to break some off
2022-07-27 21:56:14.811 Dean:    but flexible
2022-07-27 21:56:11.533 Dean:    and very strong
2022-07-27 21:56:07.762 Dean:    very adhesive
2022-07-27 21:56:02.766 Dean:    I feel it is a silicon of some sort
2022-07-27 21:55:44.520 Dean:    but it is much more likely to stick to shiny surfaces
2022-07-27 21:55:18.224 Dean:    it is like, in texture like a more brittle, more rubbery,  hardened hot glue
2022-07-27 19:53:56.822 Dean:    no odour
2022-07-27 19:53:20.691 Dean:    but it is not slimy at all
2022-07-27 19:53:11.734 Dean:    it is like a white silicon
2022-07-27 19:52:59.531 Dean:    do you happen to know what the compound might be?
2022-07-27 19:52:47.447 Dean:    rubberised
2022-07-27 19:52:42.542 Dean:    and semi-hard
2022-07-27 19:52:35.932 Dean:    it is white
2022-07-27 19:52:31.719 Dean:    and to hold the battery to the battery box
2022-07-27 19:52:15.061 Dean:    s
2022-07-27 19:52:13.485 Dean:    that has been used to secure cable in place
2022-07-27 19:52:00.900 Dean:    there is a lot of squirted 'potting compound'
2022-07-27 19:51:42.630 Dean:    in the ebike battery
2022-07-27 19:51:36.951 Dean:    
2022-07-27 18:26:57.372 Dean:    years ago
2022-07-27 18:26:45.507 Dean:    not modified it since it was completed
2022-07-27 18:21:19.575 Dean:    I'll see what I can do!
2022-07-27 18:21:13.943 Dean:    some time ago
2022-07-27 18:21:07.481 Dean:    I cannot remember if I added a date validation
2022-07-27 18:20:45.556 Dean:    and perhaps an extra validation on the date
2022-07-27 18:20:21.780 Dean:    I will have to add a log
2022-07-27 17:19:23.744 Dean:    but not a week!
2022-07-27 17:19:18.847 Dean:    so it can be out a few hours
2022-07-27 17:19:07.699 Dean:    it does not always get the chance to do so when I turn the laptop on and say hello
2022-07-27 17:18:40.203 Dean:    and it is set to do so automatically
2022-07-27 17:18:32.070 Dean:    but the weather tool automatically gets the weather whilst my laptop is on
2022-07-27 17:18:03.976 Dean:    perhaps I haven't done so
2022-07-27 17:17:56.034 Dean:    I don't think so
2022-07-27 17:17:51.034 Dean:    but have I failed to paste the weather for a week?
2022-07-27 17:17:35.079 Dean:    sometimes I have copied and pasted before I have refreshed
2022-07-27 17:17:13.000 Dean:    yes, but that's because I didn't do a refresh
2022-07-27 14:33:00.424 Dean:    FCW just working on the logic for editing a line and inserting it back into the output array
2022-07-27 14:32:22.443 Dean:    I have managed to do a little coding, first time for days
2022-07-27 14:32:08.497 Dean:    
2022-07-27 14:32:06.991 Dean:    Strange
2022-07-27 14:31:42.511 Dean:    
2022-07-27 14:31:33.526 Dean:    but I imagine it won't
2022-07-27 14:31:19.865 Dean:    maybe I could add a log if it happens again
2022-07-27 14:30:49.842 Dean:    too late to look now
2022-07-27 14:30:39.654 Dean:    I suggest from the time there was a problem with generating the data
2022-07-27 14:29:50.961 Dean:    it has the latest weather
2022-07-27 14:29:43.855 Dean:    and when the hourglass stops rotating
2022-07-27 14:29:28.509 Dean:    a double-click on the weather widget
2022-07-27 14:29:15.086 Dean:    before I sent it
2022-07-27 14:29:06.398 Dean:    I caused it to do a refresh of the data
2022-07-27 14:28:01.431 Dean:    That hasn't happened before and somehow I feel it isn't a programming error on my part
2022-07-27 14:26:25.533 Dean:    What happened there?

2022-07-15 09:21:46.337 Dean:    I would suggest it is only good for a 1 amp table lamp
2022-07-15 09:21:10.680 Dean:    I bought it largely to see if it fitted the description
2022-07-15 09:20:55.142 Dean:    the build is definitely not 10 amp
2022-07-15 09:20:38.896 Dean:    has no strain relief
2022-07-15 09:20:30.891 Dean:    bought another inline switch from a different supplier, supposedly 10amp with a lamp indicator

2022-07-13 19:28:16.636 Dean:    on the ebike battery
2022-07-13 19:28:08.993 Dean:    but still...
2022-07-13 19:28:02.862 Dean:    I know it is safe as there is no circuit
2022-07-13 19:27:51.000 Dean:    in the garden
2022-07-13 19:27:48.119 Dean:    cutting a power cable this evening
2022-07-13 19:27:39.342 Dean:    
2022-07-13 19:27:31.890 Dean:    it is rather a large motor-cycle-looking pushbike though
2022-07-13 19:26:21.909 Dean:    never had a push bike with a brake lamp before
2022-07-13 19:25:50.674 Dean:    meaning it chucks out a lot of light
2022-07-13 19:25:41.136 Dean:    but the light emits from the edges as well as the face
2022-07-13 19:25:23.875 Dean:    it looks like a much larger when fitted into the bullet lamp
2022-07-13 18:09:38.210 Dean:    the lamp incorporated into old shell, fitted, charged and running

2022-07-13 14:39:20.395 Dean:    it is in a very strange place
2022-07-13 14:39:13.455 Dean:    cut a hole in the plastic lens so that the on/off button can be depressed
2022-07-13 14:22:46.563 Dean:    glued the lamp into the reflector with epoxy
2022-07-13 14:22:10.570 Dean:    I have drilled out the old rear lamp reflector so I can fit the brake light inside and access the charging port
2022-07-13 14:21:21.509 Dean:    it has multiple LEDs and is very bright and also quite small in diameter, just less that 2"
2022-07-13 14:20:33.311 Dean:    rechargeable
2022-07-13 14:20:28.376 Dean:    and when you brake the light shines bright
2022-07-13 14:20:15.884 Dean:    it has a movement sensor
2022-07-13 14:20:08.645 Dean:    purchased an automatic brake light with no external connections

2022-07-12 13:46:03.106 Dean:    
2022-07-12 13:45:54.087 Dean:    stops the wires from wiggling too
2022-07-12 13:45:37.514 Dean:    in a bike that is important
2022-07-12 13:45:29.776 Dean:    the potting is quite deep and is designed mostly to prevent mechanical movement

2022-07-12 13:33:20.103 Dean:    so, I'll put a 40a fuse in it, cut the main wire, solder to the fuse wires and shrinkwrap
2022-07-12 13:32:39.883 Dean:    it fits
2022-07-12 13:32:34.087 Dean:    fitted a 40amp very solid inline fuse to the side of the battery to test fit with the case in place
2022-07-12 13:32:11.080 Dean:    
2022-07-12 13:32:10.205 Dean:    righto
2022-07-12 11:56:59.733 Dean:    that is when the problems occur
2022-07-12 11:56:51.502 Dean:    be careful going downwards
2022-07-12 11:02:17.102 Dean:    how are the other folks coping without the lift?
2022-07-12 11:02:01.598 Dean:    
2022-07-12 11:01:13.210 Dean:    if I can make it fit
2022-07-12 11:01:08.818 Dean:    it might work for the 40amp output fuse
2022-07-12 11:00:51.675 Dean:    and it was chunky
2022-07-12 11:00:45.880 Dean:    but I found only one  fuse holder
2022-07-12 11:00:32.969 Dean:    I looked in my parts bin
2022-07-12 11:00:23.043 Dean:    so, a little unexpected work and a short delay whilst I wait for the parts
2022-07-12 10:59:59.613 Dean:    I look at the other batteries I have and no fuses at all
2022-07-12 10:59:42.484 Dean:    I am surprised these batteries are not fused better than they are
2022-07-12 10:59:23.494 Dean:    seems sensible
2022-07-12 10:59:15.752 Dean:    40amp
2022-07-12 10:59:12.506 Dean:    I may also add one on the output
2022-07-12 10:58:53.062 Dean:    so I have ordered automotive inline fuse holders for blade fuses
2022-07-12 10:58:24.649 Dean:    
2022-07-12 10:58:22.680 Dean:    lots
2022-07-12 10:58:20.701 Dean:    lost of solder!
2022-07-12 10:58:15.641 Dean:    it was just as scary de-soldering and resoldering the fuse with all that heat and potential solder splashes
2022-07-12 10:57:35.856 Dean:    and that seems silly
2022-07-12 10:57:17.239 Dean:    but it was a 15mm square PCB with the wires and a blade fuse all hard-soldered
2022-07-12 10:56:53.218 Dean:    there was a fuse
2022-07-12 10:56:49.426 Dean:    so with the fuse removable then a circuit will be easier to work on
2022-07-12 10:56:24.218 Dean:    and solder splashes are a thing
2022-07-12 10:56:13.539 Dean:    it is a big amp battery at 36v
2022-07-12 10:55:54.981 Dean:    just so I can solder without fear of short circuiting
2022-07-12 10:55:31.555 Dean:    so I have ordered and am going to fit an inline blade fuse 5a on the input side
2022-07-12 10:54:59.596 Dean:    and that I am unhappy with that
2022-07-12 10:54:51.714 Dean:    I have realised that the battery has no internal fuses
2022-07-12 10:54:33.968 Dean:    I have paused on my battery switch repair
2022-07-12 10:54:09.959 Dean:    but only just
2022-07-12 10:54:03.647 Dean:    Morning!
2022-07-12 10:53:54.297 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-07-11 22:59:02.093 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-07-11 21:37:36.469 Dean:    reassembling now
2022-07-11 21:37:23.342 Dean:    then potted the whole thing
2022-07-11 19:40:11.373 Dean:    so much stronger than before
2022-07-11 19:40:00.462 Dean:    then expoxied it in place
2022-07-11 19:39:49.132 Dean:    then I shaped and glued a piece of plastic to separate the two lugs and prevent short circuits
2022-07-11 19:37:58.371 Dean:    which is how it failed before
2022-07-11 19:37:46.743 Dean:    after soldering I superglued the daughter board to prevent mechanical failure
2022-07-11 19:37:14.045 Dean:    s
2022-07-11 19:37:12.096 Dean:    but I saved it, unsoldered it and refitted it to the new input cocket
2022-07-11 19:36:52.107 Dean:    strange
2022-07-11 19:36:45.912 Dean:    and the lugs fit through slots in the micro PCB and fold around it
2022-07-11 19:36:19.872 Dean:    it fits on the back a standard 5.5mm 2.5mm pin jack DC socket
2022-07-11 19:35:39.343 Dean:    to allow perpendicular soldering rather than straight into the back
2022-07-11 19:35:02.858 Dean:    on the back of the input socket the designer of the bike has mounted a 10mm square PCB
2022-07-11 19:34:19.506 Dean:    
2022-07-11 15:19:03.033 Dean:    for desoldering
2022-07-11 15:18:43.097 Dean:    have to dismantle the case, remove all the potting compound, free the connectors pins
2022-07-11 15:18:09.740 Dean:    that is only connecting when the plug is at an angle
2022-07-11 15:17:40.339 Dean:    to replace the bayonet connection point
2022-07-11 15:17:21.905 Dean:    dismantling a battery for the ebike
2022-07-11 15:17:06.625 Dean:    
2022-07-11 08:58:16.559 Dean:    a restart was required
2022-07-11 08:58:09.336 Dean:    so it wasn't doing things properly
2022-07-11 08:57:57.940 Dean:    YWE died shortly afterwards

2022-07-09 09:43:17.939 Dean:    I might devaite onto something more simple

2022-07-04 12:41:59.019 Dean:    all that proposed expenditure 100 billion will result in more or less, very little
2022-07-04 12:41:29.512 Dean:    as they are top heavy
2022-07-04 12:41:23.612 Dean:    and just as expensive
2022-07-04 12:41:13.421 Dean:    they have less capable military than France
2022-07-04 12:40:53.894 Dean:    but their spend on new kit is a fraction of ours
2022-07-04 12:40:37.264 Dean:    their budget is greater or equal to the UKs 
2022-07-04 12:37:31.801 Dean:    and bound by the procurement process
2022-07-04 12:37:15.568 Dean:    it seems they are incredibly bureaucratic
2022-07-04 12:36:51.531 Dean:    whilst having some first class manufacturing
2022-07-04 12:36:30.509 Dean:    reading about German military and why it is so expensive and so incapable
2022-07-04 12:35:42.459 Dean:    that pocket guide might be useful to keep on a length of string hanging from the desktop workstation
2022-07-04 12:35:31.609 Dean:    
2022-07-04 12:34:59.620 Dean:    sound straightforward but it will be fraught with difficulties and if I can find a leg up that would really assist
2022-07-04 12:34:16.431 Dean:    the gap is the correct method and API to use to convert to a bitmap that is compatible with the dictionary object
2022-07-04 12:33:31.335 Dean:    I already extract icons in iconsettings and write them to a std picturebox
2022-07-04 12:22:51.217 Dean:    
2022-07-04 12:22:32.711 Dean:    this means that if you drag/drop to the dock it ought to be able to pick up embedded icons and if transparent will retain that
2022-07-04 12:21:51.368 Dean:     and I hope to make progress soon
2022-07-04 12:21:36.235 Dean:    I have put some probes out on the VB6 forum
2022-07-04 12:21:27.610 Dean:    which might be useful
2022-07-04 12:21:21.582 Dean:    I have sample code in C++ and VB6
2022-07-04 12:21:07.192 Dean:    I am researching which API I need to use and the arcane commands
2022-07-04 12:20:41.968 Dean:    if I have the bitmap then I can load that into the dictionary collection object I use to store the icons whilst SD is running
2022-07-04 12:20:06.984 Dean:    the next step is to extract and convert using that handle to a bitmap
2022-07-04 12:19:39.064 Dean:    I have some APIs to extract the icons that produce a handle
2022-07-04 12:19:23.233 Dean:    VB6 - SteamyDock - working on extracting icons from DLLs/EXEs
2022-07-04 12:18:51.596 Dean:    but nonoe of the qualifiers and utils
2022-07-04 12:18:41.677 Dean:    I retain
2022-07-04 12:18:37.408 Dean:    pwd, ls and ps as well as cd
2022-07-04 12:18:25.493 Dean:    but realised my other knowledge had simply evaporated
2022-07-04 12:18:10.109 Dean:    and I tried to navigate with some success
2022-07-04 12:17:57.406 Dean:    I have  a bash shell here
2022-07-04 12:17:48.653 Dean:    I was bemoaning my failure to remember my Linux commands only the other day
2022-07-04 10:34:35.004 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-07-03 20:38:44.636 Dean:    doing a big backup here
2022-07-03 20:38:38.429 Dean:    
2022-07-03 20:38:35.664 Dean:    should do
2022-07-03 19:32:39.203 Dean:    I know that the earthing rods are clamped
2022-07-03 18:52:16.741 Dean:    that was a joke...
2022-07-03 18:52:10.048 Dean:    you might have to weld them!
2022-07-03 18:51:32.732 Dean:    at 10mm
2022-07-03 18:51:29.009 Dean:    but you probably don't have enough copper
2022-07-03 18:51:03.959 Dean:    whitworth types
2022-07-03 18:50:59.566 Dean:    only very coarse threads might take on copper
2022-07-03 18:50:23.824 Dean:    or clamp
2022-07-03 18:50:08.982 Dean:    drill a hole?
2022-07-03 13:21:56.657 Dean:    reviewing your own code from a year or so ago...
2022-07-03 13:21:40.511 Dean:    so I have them clear in my head
2022-07-03 13:21:31.936 Dean:    re-analysing the methods I use to place bitmaps into GDI+
2022-07-03 13:21:05.412 Dean:    
2022-07-03 09:54:59.103 Dean:    we will have to see when the time comes
2022-07-03 09:54:48.229 Dean:    so I am hoping it would be legal to do so
2022-07-03 09:54:32.771 Dean:    and this is simple kit
2022-07-03 09:54:15.242 Dean:    luckily I have a captive gas engineer
2022-07-03 09:54:03.042 Dean:    yup!
2022-07-03 09:53:26.476 Dean:    I doin't even look anymore
2022-07-03 09:53:19.310 Dean:    I always used to look for the UK made alternatve and paid the additional
2022-07-03 09:52:55.675 Dean:    but I think you get what I mean
2022-07-03 09:52:44.502 Dean:     a poor example
2022-07-03 09:52:36.827 Dean:    so stuff just stops being made
2022-07-03 09:52:26.078 Dean:    but we aren't making things in general as we used to
2022-07-03 09:52:10.522 Dean:    and hack in another
2022-07-03 09:52:03.805 Dean:    I am sure I could do some gas plumbing if I knew what I was doing
2022-07-03 09:51:38.746 Dean:    and those are incompatible with mine
2022-07-03 09:51:26.870 Dean:    you just import cheap Chinese valves
2022-07-03 09:51:13.566 Dean:    we aren't making them because there isn't anyone around to make those valves
2022-07-03 09:50:41.723 Dean:    will be taken out when that valve finally fails
2022-07-03 09:50:24.305 Dean:    so my solid iron Rayburn that should cook for 100 years
2022-07-03 09:50:02.108 Dean:    not making them anymore
2022-07-03 09:49:55.556 Dean:    valve UK made
2022-07-03 09:49:50.848 Dean:    I have a Rayburn that has a valve controlling the flow of gas
2022-07-03 09:49:09.656 Dean:    and I worry how much we depend upon China
2022-07-03 09:48:50.661 Dean:    China is becoming more assertive as it knows it can make everything
2022-07-03 09:48:25.017 Dean:    I think the US will find that out one day
2022-07-03 09:48:15.344 Dean:    it can find its economy at the whim of another master
2022-07-03 09:47:55.863 Dean:    and the others do not
2022-07-03 09:47:48.363 Dean:    but when one country has that manufacturing ability
2022-07-03 09:47:29.963 Dean:    that is good I suppose
2022-07-03 09:47:23.167 Dean:    as no country is self-sufficient
2022-07-03 09:47:11.680 Dean:    the world cannot afford to go to war with itself anymore
2022-07-03 09:46:57.769 Dean:    agreed
2022-07-03 09:46:45.081 Dean:    for most items
2022-07-03 09:46:36.780 Dean:    until it largely became impossible
2022-07-03 09:46:25.928 Dean:    I always bought British whenever I could but in the late 90s it became more and more difficult
2022-07-03 09:45:55.704 Dean:    and it will prove to be a mistake
2022-07-03 09:45:45.322 Dean:    we have placed ourselves in a global world where we obtain everything from foreign manufacturers
2022-07-03 09:45:14.600 Dean:    the lift -
2022-07-03 09:45:04.083 Dean:    
2022-07-03 09:45:01.396 Dean:    and I am getting getting closer
2022-07-03 09:44:52.834 Dean:    I am in the right area though
2022-07-03 09:44:44.546 Dean:    and in different languages!
2022-07-03 09:44:26.247 Dean:    but nothing quite applies
2022-07-03 09:44:20.411 Dean:    so I am having to extend my research to similar scenarios to see how others have accomplished similar things successfully
2022-07-03 09:43:46.659 Dean:    the trouble is that it is complex, andseveral peopl e have tried and I find their posts complaining that they could not do it, I see code from their failures but no follow up nor example code of anyone actually succeeding
2022-07-03 09:42:48.084 Dean:    but I am getting to grips with using examples from different languages
2022-07-03 09:42:31.766 Dean:    the command used are arcane, complex and beyond my current understanding
2022-07-03 09:41:56.764 Dean:    It seems that I need to read the icon data and et a handle to the data in memory and write that to a bitmap in memory and then read that into the same device context of the screen display
2022-07-03 09:40:48.763 Dean:    
2022-07-03 09:40:46.319 Dean:    a lot of functionality (the larger part) is undocumented
2022-07-03 09:40:21.118 Dean:    when it is needed
2022-07-03 09:40:13.126 Dean:    MS provides a lot but also very little
2022-07-03 09:40:00.369 Dean:    I have to find out how to place into the the device context of the screen directly using GDI+
2022-07-03 09:39:27.058 Dean:    but it outputs to a stdpicture box
2022-07-03 09:39:12.713 Dean:    and it allows me to see a icon in the dock
2022-07-03 09:35:04.762 Dean:    it works to a certain extent and I use it in the icon settings tool to extract and display an icon from a drag/dropped binary
2022-07-03 09:33:31.725 Dean:    at the time I used it, the only bit of documentation was in Chinese, later found someone utilising it using C with comment sin German I think
2022-07-03 09:32:15.230 Dean:    I have found a while back an undocumented API that extracts icons of all sizes from a binary
2022-07-03 09:31:29.555 Dean:    Windows embeds its programs icons within each EXE or DLL
2022-07-03 09:31:06.402 Dean:    coded last night, or rather researched how to do something
2022-07-03 09:30:39.986 Dean:    Clear sky
2022-07-03 09:30:15.353 Dean:    Morning!
2022-07-02 22:52:09.612 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-07-02 22:37:33.233 Dean:    and probably better
2022-07-02 22:37:28.251 Dean:    She will do just as well there
2022-07-02 22:37:13.598 Dean:    You are absolutely correct
2022-07-02 22:35:58.991 Dean:    I am actually quite excited!
2022-07-02 22:35:47.502 Dean:    and I need to do things like going to see my friends!
2022-07-02 22:34:43.993 Dean:    to the best of my ability
2022-07-02 22:34:35.416 Dean:    What I promised Dad I have fulfilled
2022-07-02 22:34:16.798 Dean:    My duty is done
2022-07-02 22:34:09.914 Dean:    and I'm not spending time with them
2022-07-02 22:34:02.809 Dean:    My children grew two years...
2022-07-02 22:33:53.116 Dean:    and I have other things to do
2022-07-02 22:33:46.746 Dean:    and although I am doing some coding here it is at 1/20th of the speed I should be 
2022-07-02 22:33:15.284 Dean:    I think, in reality that I have come to realise that my life is evaporating
2022-07-02 22:30:58.907 Dean:    so, have to get my head around the concept
2022-07-02 22:30:40.243 Dean:    with only one break
2022-07-02 22:30:34.598 Dean:    At that time proposed (December-ish) I will have been looking after Mum for two years
2022-07-02 22:29:59.468 Dean:    even though the decision is mine
2022-07-02 22:29:49.556 Dean:    I still can't quite accept or believe that might be happening
2022-07-02 22:29:32.720 Dean:    Let's organise later when Mum's new home becomes a reality
2022-07-02 22:28:46.768 Dean:    haven't been on a canal boat for decades
2022-07-02 22:28:30.235 Dean:    I'd love to see the boat
2022-07-02 22:28:21.949 Dean:    It is a definite possibility then
2022-07-02 22:25:57.324 Dean:    IS the boat out of the water every year? or every two/three years
2022-07-02 22:25:32.242 Dean:    so I suggest some time next year in the Spring/early Summer
2022-07-02 22:25:02.105 Dean:    it'll have to wait until we are all settled
2022-07-02 22:24:47.213 Dean:    It would be fun
2022-07-02 22:21:18.253 Dean:    it took ages
2022-07-02 22:21:12.112 Dean:    I have just added ALL the balloon tooltips
2022-07-02 22:21:01.032 Dean:    
2022-07-02 22:20:38.369 Dean:    but it ought to weld
2022-07-02 22:20:31.926 Dean:    and it may create a poor weld
2022-07-02 22:20:22.381 Dean:    it may not be very controllable
2022-07-02 22:20:08.995 Dean:    I don't see why it should not weld
2022-07-02 20:38:47.280 Dean:    and I'd love to see your set up
2022-07-02 20:38:36.579 Dean:    I just think we ought to meet at least once
2022-07-02 20:38:27.052 Dean:    as you are a carer and have multiple jobs to do
2022-07-02 20:38:14.768 Dean:    I wouldn't want to give you more to worry you
2022-07-02 20:37:27.824 Dean:    would that be too much of an imposition?
2022-07-02 20:37:19.572 Dean:    love to see your projects in the flesh as it were, and the canal boat
2022-07-02 20:37:00.440 Dean:    sometime in the following year
2022-07-02 20:36:49.094 Dean:    when Mum goes, going in a home at about Xmas I believe, would you take a visit from me?
2022-07-02 20:36:20.070 Dean:    I want to see it in action
2022-07-02 20:36:13.099 Dean:    I am very impressed you are actually building this
2022-07-02 20:35:59.079 Dean:    understood
2022-07-02 18:31:03.432 Dean:    sorting that out
2022-07-02 18:30:56.550 Dean:    I was unhappy with some of the fonts when greying out due to disabling
2022-07-02 18:30:42.287 Dean:    I am doing some tidying up of the GUI interface on the dock Settings tool
2022-07-02 18:30:26.473 Dean:    
2022-07-02 18:30:24.185 Dean:    :)
2022-07-02 11:55:01.260 Dean:    what are you planning to do with the Pico?
2022-07-02 11:24:17.973 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:24:15.975 Dean:    all's well with you?
2022-07-02 11:22:04.092 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:21:50.535 Dean:    and you keep the spreadsheet up to date as you go
2022-07-02 11:21:14.079 Dean:    and it really helps if all expenditure comes from the one account
2022-07-02 11:20:42.729 Dean:    so basic accountancy is required
2022-07-02 11:20:29.864 Dean:    if it does not balance you cannot submit it
2022-07-02 11:20:13.050 Dean:    so, you have to have a double-entry spreadsheet wit all the same categories of expenditure type
2022-07-02 11:19:42.784 Dean:    and it is merely a few boxes that you fiill in values
2022-07-02 11:19:26.207 Dean:    it is done by a web interface online
2022-07-02 11:19:13.103 Dean:    re: attorney, if it is similar to what we have to do, a yearly financial report has to be done reflecting all mum's income/outgoings that has to balance
2022-07-02 11:18:21.182 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:18:17.177 Dean:    looks good
2022-07-02 11:18:13.950 Dean:    [quote] Spent some time this morning ordering a new "Faucet Spray Head" for the kitchen tap. The original crapped out yesterday - not worth the bother of fixing it. [/quote] 
2022-07-02 11:17:41.758 Dean:    just touched Dave Rice via email to see what he has to say, he was searching on subversion for old source code last time we spoke
2022-07-02 11:17:08.940 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:02:42.678 Dean:    how do you handle that?
2022-07-02 11:02:32.541 Dean:    what do you use for source version control?
2022-07-02 11:02:15.262 Dean:    I did a little programming but reverted the code when I realised I was barking down the wrong tree
2022-07-02 11:01:50.018 Dean:    might be able to find some time to add more individual tooltips to the dock settings tool
2022-07-02 11:01:23.294 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:01:18.234 Dean:    so, having completed it (whilst looking after mum)  is a weight of my shoulders
2022-07-02 11:00:24.300 Dean:    we had, after all, always done it this way for 8 or so years
2022-07-02 11:00:00.468 Dean:    we bought all Mum's requirements when shopping within our own all on the same card
2022-07-02 10:59:33.683 Dean:    so, having to dig back almost a year and a half ago to build a detailed picture of Mum's expenditure is jsut nor possible
2022-07-02 10:58:54.149 Dean:    as we did not know we would need to!
2022-07-02 10:58:46.340 Dean:    and we weren't keeping detailed financial records of expenditure
2022-07-02 10:58:29.394 Dean:    they wanted questions answering re: expenditure during a period after Dad's death when we were just coping with that and Mum's unexpected care
2022-07-02 10:57:48.640 Dean:    very pleased that is done
2022-07-02 10:57:13.323 Dean:    re: Mum's guardianship
2022-07-02 10:57:05.452 Dean:    late to bed last night after finishing the report to the Court of Protection
2022-07-02 10:56:31.147 Dean:     Windspeed is 13 knots, force 4, direction SSW
2022-07-02 10:56:31.147 Dean:     Scattered clouds at 3700 ft.

2022-07-02 10:56:22.273 Dean:    Done anything interesting worth telling?
2022-07-01 22:55:20.631 Dean:    worked most of the day on spreadsheets for the court of protection for Mum guardianship
2022-07-01 22:51:52.204 Dean:    no coding 
2022-07-01 14:43:13.051 Dean:    spent best part of four hours cleaning
2022-07-01 14:43:01.127 Dean:    after a big mistake from Mum
2022-07-01 14:42:51.196 Dean:    lots of cleanoing to do
2022-07-01 14:42:45.577 Dean:    bad day here
2022-07-01 09:21:50.546 Dean:    we tried it before and failed
2022-07-01 09:21:24.586 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-07-01 09:21:22.860 Dean:    Hello!
2022-07-01 09:21:15.757 Dean:    Well, encryption for firecall
2022-06-30 17:52:23.883 Dean:    startup manager -complete the graphics for that
2022-06-30 17:51:58.779 Dean:    get that signal widget working and tied to something, possibly network connectivity
2022-06-30 17:51:03.146 Dean:    add a rain alarm to the weather widget
2022-06-30 17:50:15.172 Dean:    Get all widgets to maintain/restore their position when an app goes full screen

2022-06-30 10:56:03.925 Dean:    but I do not have time
2022-06-30 10:55:56.610 Dean:    it would look good on the desktop
2022-06-30 10:55:03.950 Dean:    combining the moon widget with one of the panzer gauges
2022-06-30 10:54:44.322 Dean:    I want to make a combined yahoo widget
2022-06-30 09:51:26.347 Dean:    it feels possible for my small brain
2022-06-30 09:51:06.089 Dean:    then I need to look at some examples as to how to do the same for the mouse hover event and see what I can do to pop up a balloon tooltip on controls that currently don't want to
2022-06-30 09:50:12.891 Dean:    VB6 came out before scrollwheels were a thing
2022-06-30 09:50:01.722 Dean:    on the scrollbars
2022-06-30 09:49:51.828 Dean:    then I can intercept, look at some values for mouse scrollwheel and then use those to set the vertical scroll
2022-06-30 09:49:20.206 Dean:    have to use some APIs to set tabs on certain controls and look for the messages going to/from the controls
2022-06-30 09:48:50.936 Dean:    it seems strightforward
2022-06-30 09:48:41.614 Dean:    and researching subclassing
2022-06-30 09:48:28.259 Dean:    changing the tooltips to balloon types on the 2nd pane of the dock settings util.
2022-06-30 09:48:08.385 Dean:    some small coding
2022-06-30 08:20:56.357 Dean:

2022-06-30 08:20:34.272 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-29 22:56:41.536 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-06-29 09:11:24.127 Dean:    overcast here
2022-06-29 09:11:17.649 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-28 22:23:46.518 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-06-28 16:21:17.012 Dean:    needs a gas? supply
2022-06-28 16:21:02.261 Dean:    heating as you require it
2022-06-28 16:20:52.329 Dean:    are they cheaper to use?
2022-06-28 16:20:44.089 Dean:    in the old days many houses use to have one of those
2022-06-28 14:40:30.093 Dean:    the sub classing is a thing that advanced VB6-ers are quite used to so it may well be sensible to get it under my belt.
2022-06-28 14:26:22.078 Dean:    so I have to find another workaround or do the final balloons when all is done
2022-06-28 14:25:43.308 Dean:    
2022-06-28 14:25:40.964 Dean:    as it gives problems during development, crashing the IDE, not freeing up threads &c
2022-06-28 14:25:13.005 Dean:    it is the last thing you apply before shipping
2022-06-28 14:25:03.838 Dean:    but it is not a technology that you want to have active during development
2022-06-28 14:24:43.847 Dean:    I have a solution but it is a kludge and an extension of VB6 using sub-classing to catch messages to/from the control and add my code to them that way
2022-06-28 14:23:56.756 Dean:    but the dock settings tool uses a lot of them
2022-06-28 14:23:47.875 Dean:    not a problem on the ico. settings tool
2022-06-28 14:23:37.260 Dean:    The method I am using to generate the balloon tooltips does not work on drop down combo boxes
2022-06-28 12:27:44.622 Dean:    but over time it has won me over
2022-06-28 12:27:37.309 Dean:    I always thought TimeTeam was a bit ephemeral and lightweight
2022-06-28 12:27:17.491 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW3UQEDQ0zQ
2022-06-28 12:27:09.203 Dean:    watching time team in another window
2022-06-28 12:26:56.572 Dean:    
2022-06-28 12:26:50.910 Dean:    I've done it on the icon settings tool and FCW so, I now need to be consistent on the dock settings tool
2022-06-28 12:26:16.098 Dean:    I copy the tooltip text to the balloon text area and then later I will have to add some more colour and information to the balloon text, straight from the HTML help
2022-06-28 12:25:23.998 Dean:    painful to do
2022-06-28 12:25:03.379 Dean:    on one pane there might be 30 controls
2022-06-28 12:24:24.183 Dean:    I also have to modify the pasted code to include the control name
2022-06-28 12:24:00.194 Dean:    and adding code to the MouseOver event and then adding two bits of text to form the balloon title and text
2022-06-28 12:22:43.388 Dean:    this involves double clicking individually on each and every control on six panes
2022-06-28 12:21:47.184 Dean:    adding balloon tooltips to the dock settings tool
2022-06-28 09:14:47.625 Dean:    very silly

2022-06-27 21:56:23.526 Dean:    I know them well
2022-06-27 13:26:11.465 Dean:    so expensive now
2022-06-27 13:26:03.040 Dean:    great cars
2022-06-27 13:17:59.633 Dean:    on that Rover 75
2022-06-27 13:17:47.482 Dean:    a BIG job
2022-06-27 13:15:18.756 Dean:    the issue is unsprung weight as with the motors in the wheels  the weight has moved below the springs
2022-06-27 13:14:47.912 Dean:    but this is a single monolithic motor
2022-06-27 13:14:36.261 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R_aDtfwC2o
2022-06-27 13:14:33.881 Dean:    This chap did it with a Rover 75!
2022-06-27 13:13:11.397 Dean:    I know womeone who has already replaced his diesel engine with a single electric motor from a Tesla or similar
2022-06-27 13:12:40.810 Dean:    then it will be less of an issue
2022-06-27 13:12:27.739 Dean:    but as those become regular OEM replacements and 'normal' on most cars
2022-06-27 13:11:53.561 Dean:    yes, of course and certainly initially
2022-06-27 11:04:59.459 Dean:    
2022-06-27 11:04:56.263 Dean:    at least I didn't
2022-06-27 11:04:27.454 Dean:    LED lighting is a revolution that we did not anticipate
2022-06-27 11:03:58.250 Dean:    and goes in directions that can be unexpected
2022-06-27 11:03:48.246 Dean:    technology works in interesting ways
2022-06-27 11:03:33.035 Dean:    
2022-06-27 11:03:27.493 Dean:    (perhaps)
2022-06-27 11:03:21.431 Dean:    and you may be able to replace your wheels on an existing diesel car with in wheel motors
2022-06-27 11:03:01.715 Dean:    I think this technology will mature withon 5-10 years
2022-06-27 11:02:37.637 Dean:    they exist already for small electric vehicles but for the main motor of an electric car they are still using a single monolithic brushless motor such as in Teslas
2022-06-27 11:01:39.741 Dean:    https://www.proteanelectric.com/
2022-06-27 11:01:38.175 Dean:    the idea is that you can mount a motor on each wheel hub, replacing the current wheel, disc brake hub
2022-06-27 10:59:46.903 Dean:    but they are maturing and about to arrive in vehicles such as cars
2022-06-27 10:59:26.965 Dean:    we already have small in-wheel motors in smaller vehicles such as ebikes
2022-06-27 10:59:00.772 Dean:    another is in-wheel motors in automotive applications
2022-06-27 10:58:42.680 Dean:    
2022-06-27 10:58:31.664 Dean:    the arduinos are now quick enough to be able to do in software what a dedicated cpu used to do inside a car's engine computer
2022-06-27 10:57:45.473 Dean:    these were in their infancy a mere 7-8 years ago
2022-06-27 10:57:28.490 Dean:    and there are now open source projects for replacing the EFI system inside a series of high performance but now standard cars
2022-06-27 10:56:43.719 Dean:    vehicles have a computer heart for the engine itself
2022-06-27 10:56:20.939 Dean:    https://diy-efi.co.uk/
2022-06-27 10:56:19.437 Dean:    one interesting one (for me) is the Speeduino
2022-06-27 10:55:58.389 Dean:    new technologies:
2022-06-27 09:58:03.282 Dean:    
2022-06-27 09:58:01.190 Dean:    a weekly backup might be more sensible
2022-06-27 09:57:51.897 Dean:    so I have to keep pairing them down
2022-06-27 09:57:41.738 Dean:    daily backups take a lot of space cumulatively
2022-06-27 09:57:26.633 Dean:    
2022-06-27 09:57:00.450 Dean:    Now I have reminded myself I will set up that cron job
2022-06-27 09:56:42.269 Dean:    but I currently don't
2022-06-27 09:56:37.371 Dean:    I should do the same for email (thunderbird) 
2022-06-27 09:56:06.473 Dean:    as losing your browser profile can be just as painful and is vulnerable to file system, o/s and application corruptions
2022-06-27 09:55:24.698 Dean:    I have a schedule job that runs daily backing up the whole user profile to my 2nd drive
2022-06-27 09:54:52.495 Dean:    that store the whole user profile (which means everything in FF including passwords &c)
2022-06-27 09:54:22.058 Dean:    for tools like firefox
2022-06-27 09:54:13.620 Dean:    I won't let them
2022-06-27 09:54:09.028 Dean:    the user appdata folder, some apps like to install in there for some reason
2022-06-27 09:53:33.186 Dean:    no corruption other than what the file system might accidentally do
2022-06-27 09:53:11.500 Dean:    I sit all my documents under a \DEAN folder in the root of a drive away from the o/s drive
2022-06-27 09:52:41.754 Dean:    I put nothing of value on the desktop nor under any of the "my" folders
2022-06-27 09:52:14.385 Dean:    as user profile corruption is a serious problem
2022-06-27 09:51:50.818 Dean:    in that case just make sure nothing is under my documents &c

2022-06-27 09:41:36.860 Dean:    adding the capability for one of my msgboxes to have that "Do not show again" checkbox
2022-06-27 09:40:35.543 Dean:    vb6 ico. sett. bug-fixing (minor) and fettling for finalisation
2022-06-27 09:35:13.137 Dean:    fine here too
2022-06-26 22:06:28.018 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-06-26 10:10:01.968 Dean:    not too bad
2022-06-26 09:53:31.962 Dean:    3/8" 7 gbp
2022-06-26 09:53:19.623 Dean:    for 5/8" example
2022-06-26 09:52:49.827 Dean:    had a look on t'net and copper rods (earth spikes) are about 13gbp
2022-06-25 15:21:41.065 Dean:    so unless the benefit is significant it really is not worth doing
2022-06-25 15:21:07.826 Dean:    and then you need locks
2022-06-25 15:21:02.392 Dean:    and you need multi-threading to play with the cache in the background
2022-06-25 15:20:41.669 Dean:    mine is very simple but I can see some of the issues, you really need structure to keep track of the cached items
2022-06-25 15:20:08.892 Dean:    you did mention that cacheing introduces lots of potential problems
2022-06-25 15:19:45.353 Dean:    
2022-06-25 15:19:42.201 Dean:    which will certainlt do in the rare event of a deletion of an icon
2022-06-25 15:19:23.188 Dean:    and I have a workaround
2022-06-25 15:19:16.237 Dean:    I'll get to the bottom of it
2022-06-25 15:19:09.164 Dean:    and it appears not to have gone until a short time has passed
2022-06-25 15:18:40.985 Dean:    When it is cleared down by .clear you can still check the existence of an item in the list
2022-06-25 15:18:07.325 Dean:    I am sure it is
2022-06-25 15:18:04.200 Dean:    and whether it is really asynch.
2022-06-25 15:17:48.691 Dean:    The imageList I am using it not from Microsoft so I will be able to inquire from the dev how it does what it does
2022-06-25 15:17:03.681 Dean:    I just refresh the cache, set a flag not to use the cache, refresh the grid and re-enable cacheing
2022-06-25 15:16:24.636 Dean:    I have done a workaround for the deletion of a cached item from the thumbnail list
2022-06-25 15:15:53.697 Dean:    
2022-06-25 14:11:40.867 Dean:    copper is very expensive at the moment
2022-06-25 14:10:51.226 Dean:    sometimes, house ground insulators use copper rod
2022-06-25 13:25:56.243 Dean:    it is bloody annoying that is what it is
2022-06-25 13:20:11.888 Dean:    so difficult to test
2022-06-25 13:20:00.073 Dean:    only occurs in the binary form
2022-06-25 13:19:43.686 Dean:    and it acts differently in the IDE and in the compiled binary
2022-06-25 13:03:24.624 Dean:    I need to get it to report when complete
2022-06-25 13:03:07.564 Dean:    but that clearance is happening asynchronously
2022-06-25 13:02:51.162 Dean:    as the cache is maintained via an imagelist control I issue a .clear but it obviously takes some time to complete
2022-06-25 13:02:09.557 Dean:    this is despite clearing down the cache
2022-06-25 13:01:59.939 Dean:    when I delete an icon from the thumbnails it generates an icon already in the cache error
2022-06-25 13:01:28.690 Dean:    Doing some debugging
2022-06-25 09:59:00.133 Dean:    
2022-06-25 09:58:58.415 Dean:     Windspeed is 10 knots, force 3, direction SSW
2022-06-25 09:58:58.415 Dean:     Scattered clouds at 3500 ft.

2022-06-25 09:53:07.273 Dean:    up late!
2022-06-25 09:53:00.518 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-24 22:30:32.908 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-06-24 19:17:22.237 Dean:    <><>forms-designer.png
2022-06-24 19:14:44.195 Dean:    probably c++
2022-06-24 19:14:31.474 Dean:    the DLLs are written in some form of C
2022-06-24 19:13:43.329 Dean:    as it is all provided in the form of DLLs
2022-06-24 19:13:32.806 Dean:    and can be created using VB6
2022-06-24 19:13:19.274 Dean:    very impressive
2022-06-24 19:13:15.398 Dean:    very good
2022-06-24 19:13:11.613 Dean:    for building forms with activeX controls
2022-06-24 19:12:52.362 Dean:    and it has a complete functioning drag and drop GUI designer
2022-06-24 19:12:32.574 Dean:    it has one built in
2022-06-24 19:12:24.569 Dean:    and it allows insertion of an external editor, I knopw how to do that anyway
2022-06-24 19:11:53.939 Dean:    so I found this https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12560/Form-Designer
2022-06-24 19:11:35.411 Dean:    is abnormal
2022-06-24 19:11:28.644 Dean:    and a transparent object without a traditional square shape
2022-06-24 19:10:47.152 Dean:    the concept of a graphic 'object' that can have any valid property and just needs code to be bound to events is not window-ish
2022-06-24 19:09:33.666 Dean:    meaning that they all build similar looking applications based upon standard controls
2022-06-24 19:09:02.310 Dean:    almost all windows designers make use of activeX controls
2022-06-24 19:08:47.849 Dean:    it will be not of any use to us
2022-06-24 19:08:39.214 Dean:    but
2022-06-24 19:08:37.455 Dean:    I discovered one
2022-06-24 16:21:31.112 Dean:    ah!
2022-06-24 13:43:33.158 Dean:    I am looking for an open source designer
2022-06-24 13:42:59.842 Dean:    not much better than that but it would be a  nice start
2022-06-24 13:42:47.135 Dean:    a double click on a control would take you to the associated event
2022-06-24 13:42:23.455 Dean:    attaching to a drag and drop designer
2022-06-24 13:42:12.768 Dean:    it is just a working example of something I could build
2022-06-24 13:41:50.285 Dean:    there will be lots of flaws
2022-06-24 13:41:42.200 Dean:    and see how it goes
2022-06-24 13:41:36.998 Dean:    drop some .js code into it
2022-06-24 13:41:24.744 Dean:    the search might work
2022-06-24 13:41:17.583 Dean:    the buttons are mostly trial
2022-06-24 13:41:09.230 Dean:    scintilla editor embedded within VB6 window
2022-06-24 13:40:48.780 Dean:    from trusted source
2022-06-24 13:40:43.763 Dean:    I just compiled this myself
2022-06-24 13:40:33.356 Dean:    <><>jsEditor.exe
2022-06-24 12:02:50.411 Dean:    looking good
2022-06-24 09:56:41.374 Dean:    just a small task
2022-06-24 09:56:38.224 Dean:    some coding to do today
2022-06-24 09:44:20.945 Dean:    just a few icon updates

2022-06-24 08:49:11.520 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-06-23 22:38:32.218 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-23 18:45:21.359 Dean:    a little graphic work
2022-06-23 18:45:14.761 Dean:    no coding today
2022-06-23 18:44:49.740 Dean:    Ggod bless you my son
2022-06-23 18:29:00.297 Dean:    nice slippers
2022-06-23 18:28:57.315 Dean:    looking good
2022-06-23 09:32:10.390 Dean:    but she does not understand how useful it is to have stock
2022-06-23 09:31:57.535 Dean:    drives wife mad
2022-06-23 09:31:48.648 Dean:    I have a lot of junk wood!
2022-06-23 09:31:06.387 Dean:    it is now strong and flexible
2022-06-23 09:30:55.952 Dean:    without those the glue surface was quite small
2022-06-23 09:30:35.280 Dean:    I used the corner reinforcement to stop the box being crushed
2022-06-23 09:30:02.252 Dean:    and when made into a box would be hidden
2022-06-23 09:29:52.063 Dean:    I was not that worried as the ply I was using was slightly water damaged and discoloured
2022-06-23 09:28:37.069 Dean:    a bodge
2022-06-23 09:28:27.988 Dean:    I sanded it down and sealed it with PVA
2022-06-23 09:28:15.736 Dean:    my box was cut with a coarse saw so plenty of tearing
2022-06-23 09:17:26.162 Dean:    thiny ply is difficult to cut without some tearing
2022-06-23 09:17:01.908 Dean:    looking good
2022-06-23 08:52:48.686 Dean:    60% chance of rain here
2022-06-23 08:52:39.505 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-06-22 11:40:56.754 Dean:    my digital sinclair meter
2022-06-22 11:40:37.068 Dean:    box prior to finishing/sanding
2022-06-22 11:39:52.325 Dean:    <><>sinclair0001.jpg
2022-06-22 11:39:47.644 Dean:    <><>box001.jpg
2022-06-22 11:20:15.412 Dean:    it worked well
2022-06-22 11:20:10.267 Dean:    then let the PVA dry
2022-06-22 11:19:58.886 Dean:    I  hand held the plywood for 5mins until the UHU grabbed
2022-06-22 11:19:37.695 Dean:    so I used UHU on 1" square portions, separated from the PVA
2022-06-22 11:19:10.302 Dean:    and could not find the clamps!
2022-06-22 11:19:03.695 Dean:    I had to build some new pannier boxes from 3mm plywood with 1/4 dowel as corner reinforcement
2022-06-22 11:05:40.904 Dean:    it will improve the flow and design of VB6 projects
2022-06-22 11:05:19.259 Dean:    
2022-06-22 11:05:02.115 Dean:    nice to have a feature that most other languages can do by default
2022-06-22 11:04:38.254 Dean:    Now, though. TwinBasic, one of the two planned successors to VB6 is able to build DLLs
2022-06-22 11:04:02.594 Dean:    
2022-06-22 11:03:46.013 Dean:    a limitation...
2022-06-22 11:03:42.155 Dean:    
2022-06-22 11:03:38.018 Dean:    you can reference external DLLs of course but they have to be written in C or C++
2022-06-22 11:03:13.025 Dean:    for all shared code it has to be placed in shared modules that are compiled into the main binary
2022-06-22 11:02:38.547 Dean:    but a normal DLL, it does not have that capability
2022-06-22 11:02:24.009 Dean:    it can build COM/ActiveX exposed DLLs
2022-06-22 11:02:05.307 Dean:    it does not have the capability to create normal DLLs
2022-06-22 11:01:50.177 Dean:    VB6
2022-06-22 11:01:48.554 Dean:    
2022-06-22 10:52:10.847 Dean:    but it is expensive in comparison
2022-06-22 10:52:02.514 Dean:    the UHU dries quickly being solvent based
2022-06-22 10:51:52.644 Dean:    PVA is a good long term glue but has poor 'grab' when assembling
2022-06-22 10:51:23.455 Dean:    I found that when glueing I could use UHU at certain locations as it has a better 'grab' along with some good PVA for the majority
2022-06-22 10:50:05.826 Dean:    which?
2022-06-22 10:50:03.475 Dean:    how will you assemble, glue?
2022-06-22 09:16:12.622 Dean:    watched the summer solstice sun go down
2022-06-22 09:15:54.791 Dean:    cycled last night from 9 until 10:45
2022-06-22 09:15:28.664 Dean:    making real progress
2022-06-22 09:15:24.370 Dean:    gosh
2022-06-21 13:32:33.823 Dean:    and hayfever-ish
2022-06-21 13:32:24.458 Dean:    tired
2022-06-21 11:37:08.570 Dean:    afternoon
2022-06-20 23:28:20.943 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-06-20 19:59:09.312 Dean:    keep me posted with photos
2022-06-20 18:04:36.861 Dean:    you definitely need something that can interrupt the power before it spot welds the electrodes
2022-06-20 18:01:14.180 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwocVH3_1Eo&t=0s
2022-06-20 15:54:09.446 Dean:    probably pre-built on ebay
2022-06-20 15:53:59.662 Dean:    for exactly this application
2022-06-20 15:53:50.430 Dean:    there are PCB designs to provide a timed control
2022-06-20 15:53:15.814 Dean:    relay sounds like a good idea

2022-06-20 11:03:52.287 Dean:    Hmmm
2022-06-20 11:01:11.871 Dean:    trying to remember
2022-06-20 11:00:49.242 Dean:    I presume the X,Y position is stored only per widget
2022-06-20 10:59:30.682 Dean:    Do we have a widget that can determine the position of other widgets without using tellWidgets?
2022-06-20 09:32:10.916 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-19 22:10:48.853 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-06-19 19:12:37.406 Dean:    nothing wrong with that

2022-06-18 22:36:40.634 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-06-18 21:01:11.155 Dean:    I think she is exaggerating
2022-06-18 19:31:03.922 Dean:    an intelligent set of viewpoints, informative
2022-06-18 19:30:47.311 Dean:    start at the beginning of the Ukraine crisis and listen forward
2022-06-18 19:30:24.336 Dean:    Telegraph podcasts on the Ukraine really worth listening to
2022-06-18 18:50:00.416 Dean:    and I feel happier having mine in a case with someone else passing the safety checks
2022-06-18 18:49:30.216 Dean:    that's a dangerous contraption
2022-06-18 18:48:41.889 Dean:    so my round tuit is largely unpolished and little used
2022-06-18 18:48:10.388 Dean:    and mum+ all the other household tasks
2022-06-18 18:48:00.016 Dean:    completion
2022-06-18 18:47:56.031 Dean:    Focussing on the ico. sett utility
2022-06-18 18:47:37.663 Dean:    as I am not using it generally
2022-06-18 18:47:30.674 Dean:    I can give you my round tuit

2022-06-18 17:44:26.426 Dean:    but I bought one!
2022-06-18 17:44:20.536 Dean:    I've seen that method of generating a few amps and a makeshift spotwelder
2022-06-18 17:43:43.128 Dean:    That was the wrong way to extract good components from a microwave oven!
2022-06-18 15:04:55.147 Dean:    
2022-06-18 15:04:52.523 Dean:    in amongst doing everything else!
2022-06-18 15:04:40.906 Dean:    vb6 ico. sett generate tested the prepending icons automatically
2022-06-18 12:31:23.203 Dean:    now testing the prepend
2022-06-18 12:31:08.175 Dean:    feeling better at using it now, I thought I'd made it up for a moment
2022-06-18 12:02:26.628 Dean:    is prepend a real word?
2022-06-18 12:02:21.662 Dean:    next the pre-pend
2022-06-18 12:02:11.138 Dean:    vb6 ico sett. auto generate append tested and bugfixed
2022-06-18 10:49:37.285 Dean:    sounds as if the dev is having the same problems

2022-06-18 10:46:21.731 Dean:    Perhaps the environment will have matured over time
2022-06-18 10:46:02.488 Dean:    anything you needed had to be rebuilt from wireless drivers to applications
2022-06-18 10:45:35.672 Dean:    That is my criticism of Slax
2022-06-18 10:45:17.438 Dean:    to have to build
2022-06-18 10:45:10.397 Dean:    if you are going to dig into Linux it becomes a requirement
2022-06-18 10:44:54.137 Dean:    But
2022-06-18 10:40:23.674 Dean:    [quote] Porting Unix/Linux code to the Mac invariably involves running massive makefiles which never quite make it. [/quote] 
2022-06-18 10:40:16.438 Dean:    I'd agree with that
2022-06-18 10:39:31.734 Dean:    Linux Mint looking steamy

2022-06-18 10:29:44.859 Dean:    interesting but a bit off centre
2022-06-18 10:29:30.872 Dean:    Slax is usable from a USB and is a slimline linux 
2022-06-18 10:29:01.198 Dean:    Kubuntu replaced that with KDE and all it's tools resulting in a powerful o/s with widget support  (not ours but plasmoids)
2022-06-18 10:28:07.540 Dean:    Ubuntu has a poor interface (Win 8-like)
2022-06-18 10:27:44.004 Dean:    I liked Mint and found it straightforward
2022-06-18 10:27:18.189 Dean:    Mint, Kubuntu, straight Ubuntu and Slax as well as Android on phones
2022-06-18 10:26:25.281 Dean:    I have had installations of the following varieties of Linux:
2022-06-18 10:26:03.400 Dean:    Yes
2022-06-18 10:26:01.389 Dean:    
2022-06-18 09:45:00.874 Dean:    Weather any good today?
2022-06-18 09:44:53.712 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-06-17 18:39:20.636 Dean:    inside cool
2022-06-17 18:39:17.906 Dean:    very hot still

2022-06-17 09:47:05.090 Dean:    I will create a slicker version of that in VB6
2022-06-17 09:46:34.948 Dean:    should operate now
2022-06-17 09:46:29.595 Dean:    with the associated resources
2022-06-17 09:46:21.211 Dean:    that is the same binary within a folder

2022-06-17 09:23:22.628 Dean:    can you please see if it works?
2022-06-17 09:23:15.061 Dean:    that was created in QB64
2022-06-17 09:22:49.652 Dean:    <><>RunDialog.exe
2022-06-17 09:22:17.873 Dean:    back on
2022-06-17 09:22:15.075 Dean:    internet died last night
2022-06-16 23:43:41.931 Dean:    testing to do the next two days
2022-06-16 23:43:28.846 Dean:    some coding, just a little, adding code to refresh the dock after regeneration
2022-06-16 23:43:01.943 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-16 09:55:06.310 Dean:     I wanted to participate but some communities are too caustic to join
2022-06-16 09:54:39.119 Dean:     Felippe Heitor was a very nice person but he lacked the strength to control a whole community by himself. 
2022-06-16 09:54:17.765 Dean:    To my mind it was a mere matter of time before the community imploded or exploded. One or the other, and it did.
2022-06-16 09:53:40.980 Dean:    It looks as if the QB community is having its fourth rebirth after previous incarnations also died. QBASIC > QB64.net > QB64.org > QB64.com.
2022-06-16 09:52:34.864 Dean:    https://lunduke.substack.com/p/the-wild-events-that-nearly-took?s=r
2022-06-16 09:52:09.048 Dean:    I joined that community a few years ago but just as quickly left. It was full of politics leaking into normal discussions all the time
2022-06-16 09:51:49.601 Dean:    It seems that a BASIC community has just gone "tits up" and exploded in a eruption of vitriol. That being the QB64 community. QB64 is a recreation of QBasic from the 90s, a 64bit version of the IDE, compiler and language. It had a site (qb64.org) , WIKI, forum, codebank, discord server. Almost all were erased after a main contributor handed over the site to an unknown and discussion turned to argument, in turn to troubles.
2022-06-16 08:31:29.327 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-15 22:36:06.186 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-15 20:49:25.983 Dean:    tomorrow will test the prepend, overwrite and will add some flounces
2022-06-15 20:49:03.025 Dean:    the append appears to be working
2022-06-15 20:48:56.063 Dean:    
2022-06-15 20:45:45.380 Dean:    just testing the generate dock code
2022-06-15 20:45:20.056 Dean:    same as in my brother's top floor apartment
2022-06-15 16:23:24.684 Dean:    lovely and coool inside
2022-06-15 16:23:16.042 Dean:    several degrees more in London at the mo'
2022-06-15 13:06:21.231 Dean:    back
2022-06-15 12:16:48.864 Dean:    me too

2022-06-15 09:37:03.714 Dean:    ico. sett. just added the code to auto generate a new dock from the registry/start menu chosen list
2022-06-15 09:36:24.294 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-06-14 22:14:32.655 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-14 21:56:04.871 Dean:    I know the area well
2022-06-14 21:51:26.156 Dean:    It was tasty
2022-06-14 20:06:50.170 Dean:    This eve. we had bacon bits fried, on top of a cheating pasta carbonara using linguini and cream as well as steamed brocolli
2022-06-14 20:05:46.148 Dean:    and the potatoes were mashed with cream
2022-06-14 20:05:33.500 Dean:    full of flavour
2022-06-14 20:05:22.617 Dean:    We had pork with chorizo and spice
2022-06-14 19:52:33.049 Dean:    different sausages though
2022-06-14 19:52:22.379 Dean:    we had that yesterday
2022-06-14 15:44:00.008 Dean:    sounds great and very clever, however I prefer a physical key
2022-06-14 15:43:36.902 Dean:    [quote] I have a signet ring that contains an iButton - could, in principle, be used to open doors or use as an authenticator. [/quote] 
2022-06-14 15:36:01.838 Dean:    not familiar with those...
2022-06-14 15:32:40.481 Dean:    a while ago now
2022-06-14 15:32:29.883 Dean:    I used RIFDs in a project for various companies that had to test QoS for deliveries
2022-06-14 15:30:10.606 Dean:    business cards?
2022-06-14 15:29:19.941 Dean:    what will you use them to tag?
2022-06-14 14:34:23.253 Dean:    swine
2022-06-14 14:25:49.879 Dean:    just some tidying and fixing minor issues
2022-06-14 14:25:38.652 Dean:    tiny bit of coding
2022-06-14 10:23:13.755 Dean:    that needs to be in the icon settings resources folder as a subfolder
2022-06-14 10:22:55.458 Dean:    <f><f>sounds
2022-06-14 09:32:35.089 Dean:    will sort out the validation of a few vars
2022-06-14 08:33:39.814 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-14 08:33:38.204 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-06-13 23:49:43.231 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-06-13 21:15:31.743 Dean:    - but no errors!
2022-06-13 21:15:25.688 Dean:    and the generate dock utility does a little more, a backup then some code that you cannot see the results of
2022-06-13 21:14:41.959 Dean:    added some sound to msgboxes
2022-06-13 21:10:56.804 Dean:    they will be required for drag and drop icon targets
2022-06-13 21:10:33.792 Dean:    those document-nnn.png files I sentyou earlier should go in the C:\Program Files (x86)\SteamyDock\iconSettings\my collection\steampunk icons MkVI folder
2022-06-13 21:09:29.371 Dean:    still in test
2022-06-13 21:09:25.087 Dean:    mostly working
2022-06-13 21:09:14.778 Dean:    drag and drop from the desktop to the map
2022-06-13 21:09:03.747 Dean:    not much to test
2022-06-13 21:08:56.207 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-06-13 19:29:20.607 Dean:    Sausages, mash and peas
2022-06-13 12:21:04.936 Dean:    making changes now to add the required code to the generate dock routine
2022-06-13 12:20:39.602 Dean:    
2022-06-13 09:52:38.342 Dean:    The vb6 timer is very similar to the YWE timer
2022-06-13 09:40:01.914 Dean:    happy to use jscript or VB now
2022-06-13 09:39:41.990 Dean:    having used VB6 first it all seems quite familar to me
2022-06-13 09:39:27.238 Dean:    I am just going with the VB6 timer properties
2022-06-13 09:39:11.854 Dean:    I haven't tried emulating anything in YWE
2022-06-13 09:32:24.343 Dean:    finally settling on something you feel confident and happy with
2022-06-13 09:32:10.320 Dean:    that is the the trouble
2022-06-13 09:32:02.137 Dean:    [quote] There are many different ways of doing the same thing. My style has evolved - not sure it has settled. [/quote] 
2022-06-13 09:31:41.750 Dean:     similar to what you are doing
2022-06-13 09:31:25.403 Dean:    you have to code that yourself using timer APIs
2022-06-13 09:31:08.478 Dean:    and there is no form independent timer construct
2022-06-13 09:30:52.414 Dean:    they only run in the context of that form
2022-06-13 09:30:42.720 Dean:    that is convenient but
2022-06-13 09:30:29.862 Dean:    manner
2022-06-13 09:30:25.670 Dean:    so you drag timer controls to a form in the 'visual
2022-06-13 09:30:04.840 Dean:    the only main difference, a limitation is that they are tied to a form and not independent
2022-06-13 09:29:38.696 Dean:    VB6 has timer controls similar to YWE
2022-06-13 09:29:07.394 Dean:    setTimeOut?
2022-06-13 09:28:30.011 Dean:    essential
2022-06-13 09:28:27.234 Dean:    timers are very useful indeed
2022-06-13 09:26:03.128 Dean:    you only become familiar by working around the problems...
2022-06-13 09:25:36.394 Dean:    and wanting to try the VB6 way of doing things
2022-06-13 09:25:25.677 Dean:    partly this is due to teaching myself new things
2022-06-13 09:25:10.794 Dean:    [quote] It seems to be getting too complicated. [/quote] 
2022-06-13 09:24:21.830 Dean:    has similar happened to you?
2022-06-13 09:24:12.867 Dean:
2022-06-13 09:24:11.712 Dean:    then that realisation sets in ony when you encounter the new structure
2022-06-13 09:23:49.417 Dean:    and only later realise that the language has several alternative methods for dealing with a problem
2022-06-13 09:23:15.383 Dean:    and adapt that style to working in the newer language
2022-06-13 09:22:58.223 Dean:    Interesting though how one might start working in a different language in an older style
2022-06-13 09:22:01.358 Dean:    wilco
2022-06-13 09:17:21.277 Dean:    
2022-06-13 09:17:18.896 Dean:    or migrate to the in-built control?
2022-06-13 09:17:08.469 Dean:    would you leave as is?
2022-06-13 09:16:56.477 Dean:    there is no need.
2022-06-13 09:16:48.738 Dean:    but 
2022-06-13 09:16:45.099 Dean:    as the images are all the same size it would suit it too.
2022-06-13 09:16:22.265 Dean:    but the imageList would accomplish the same thing and be more elegant
2022-06-13 09:16:02.057 Dean:    I preferred this solution to a window of boxes that needed to be populated with large PNGs that need to be resized on the fly
2022-06-13 09:15:15.056 Dean:    but once they are loaded they are lightning fast to reposition
2022-06-13 09:14:45.300 Dean:    a bit clunky
2022-06-13 09:14:30.634 Dean:    and they are scrolled left and right as they physically exist beyond the frame of the application
2022-06-13 09:13:54.988 Dean:    at the moment I create picBox controls, one for each image
2022-06-13 09:13:25.536 Dean:    It could certainly be a replacement structure for the image map
2022-06-13 09:12:41.773 Dean:    but it is not to be.
2022-06-13 09:12:30.751 Dean:    I was hoping the imageList would prove to be a rather interesting item for handling pre-loaded image resources
2022-06-13 09:11:36.154 Dean:    so, I am back to picking up the images from the resources folder when I need them
2022-06-13 09:11:17.084 Dean:    adn that adds complexity that removes the need for a convenient store
2022-06-13 09:10:59.400 Dean:    and I'd have to know the original size
2022-06-13 09:10:47.746 Dean:    I can store various-sized images in the store but they are all stretched and I would have to resize them at run time
2022-06-13 09:10:20.871 Dean:    
2022-06-13 09:10:14.461 Dean:    just something I learnt about VB6, the same limitation is in VB.NET
2022-06-13 09:09:46.138 Dean:    but it removes the convenience of an image store
2022-06-13 09:09:33.508 Dean:    I could create a store for each common size
2022-06-13 09:09:19.047 Dean:    as all the images I would like to store happen to be various sizes
2022-06-13 09:08:52.861 Dean:    which is a right pain
2022-06-13 09:08:46.785 Dean:    tried it and found that all the images in an imageList need to be the same size
2022-06-13 09:08:29.769 Dean:    I am using imageLists as a cache already so I thought I'd set up a new one for image storage
2022-06-13 09:07:56.127 Dean:    there is the possibility of pre-loading them into a VB6 struct called an imageList at design time
2022-06-13 09:07:22.749 Dean:    but
2022-06-13 09:07:14.942 Dean:    I will put them in the resources folder shortly
2022-06-13 09:07:04.988 Dean:    those images exist ass .jpegs in the root currently
2022-06-13 09:06:45.534 Dean:    the correct image is put in place onto the associated control
2022-06-13 09:06:27.485 Dean:    if you select the light or high contrast themes
2022-06-13 09:06:12.131 Dean:    &c
2022-06-13 09:06:08.130 Dean:    *c
2022-06-13 09:05:57.405 Dean:    small visual buttons
2022-06-13 09:05:38.665 Dean:    I have several images that are used to theme the verious elements
2022-06-13 09:05:11.581 Dean:    On  the VB6 ico. sett. 
2022-06-13 09:05:02.396 Dean:

2022-06-13 09:04:35.021 Dean:    Perhaps they have finally got their act together?
2022-06-13 08:44:12.020 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-06-12 22:00:48.995 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-06-12 21:04:45.471 Dean:    have to think about that

2022-06-10 15:26:27.405 Dean:    
2022-06-10 12:42:49.427 Dean:    still trying to wake up though

2022-06-08 21:47:04.379 Dean:    but I did create a few new icons
2022-06-08 21:46:56.434 Dean:    very little programming
2022-06-08 09:18:15.938 Dean:    seems far too complicated

2022-06-08 08:32:48.801 Dean:    So, MS has a 64bit version of VB6 that they will not release to the users...
2022-06-08 08:32:25.465 Dean:    can't be used to build standalone apps
2022-06-08 08:32:12.181 Dean:    no proper IDE
2022-06-08 08:32:06.490 Dean:    built directly from VB6
2022-06-08 08:31:58.207 Dean:    in a few ways it is superior, being 64bit and supported
2022-06-08 08:31:31.952 Dean:    MS Excel's in-built language is VBA, a super/subset of VB6
2022-06-08 08:30:45.173 Dean:    what is it about the things that you hate?
2022-06-08 08:30:43.687 Dean:    and only then when essential
2022-06-08 08:30:36.352 Dean:    I avoided using them for a long time
2022-06-08 08:30:12.365 Dean:    I hate spreadsheets too
2022-06-08 08:29:30.489 Dean:    Morning!

2022-06-07 22:34:25.125 Dean:    working?
2022-06-07 16:18:37.149 Dean:    just running it through some test cases
2022-06-07 16:18:27.571 Dean:    
2022-06-07 16:18:24.715 Dean:    I have drag and drop implemented in to the ico.sett. map

2022-06-06 19:41:49.028 Dean:    interesting typo
2022-06-06 19:41:38.840 Dean:    that is an intertesting idea
2022-06-06 13:10:07.099 Dean:    worth doing I think
2022-06-06 13:09:51.262 Dean:    
2022-06-06 13:09:47.728 Dean:    but definitely if it is raining
2022-06-06 13:09:37.726 Dean:    or possibly on another weather value
2022-06-06 13:09:13.529 Dean:    we need an alert if it is raining

2022-06-06 13:08:56.262 Dean:    on the weather tools

2022-06-06 11:29:40.392 Dean:    and defaulted the two folder selection buttons to open C:\program files if it exists
2022-06-06 11:28:55.681 Dean:    Vb6 ico sett. added ting and dong to the exclamation and critical pop up messages

2022-06-05 22:14:56.005 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-06-05 22:14:54.139 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-06-05 22:14:53.292 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-05 21:03:32.986 Dean:    much more interesting things to listen to
2022-06-05 21:03:20.495 Dean:    youtube is now like the radio for me
2022-06-05 21:03:09.391 Dean:    in the background whilst I worked
2022-06-05 21:03:00.417 Dean:    watched lots of videos on youtube today
2022-06-05 20:34:16.136 Dean:    
2022-06-05 20:34:04.305 Dean:    but none of that is relevant
2022-06-05 20:33:56.508 Dean:    for slow systems
2022-06-05 20:33:48.957 Dean:    that were each massive in size
2022-06-05 20:33:28.213 Dean:    I would do it for 1,000s of images
2022-06-05 20:33:17.784 Dean:    and for little benefit
2022-06-05 20:33:09.018 Dean:    and we know that is where the problems start
2022-06-05 20:32:54.342 Dean:    and that would speed up the reading of the files  on a  re-opening of the app. but I would have to keep the files in the folder in synch with the cached versions
2022-06-05 20:31:53.983 Dean:    I could place the resized versions of the files into a separate cache folder but they would still need to be read as files from disc
2022-06-05 20:19:53.589 Dean:    
2022-06-05 20:13:25.473 Dean:    for very little benefit
2022-06-05 20:13:16.387 Dean:    and any attempt to cache prior to the user opening and navigating a folder feels doomed to conflict
2022-06-05 20:12:39.562 Dean:    so it all has to run in the same context
2022-06-05 20:12:28.972 Dean:    VB6 cannot multi thread
2022-06-05 20:12:19.659 Dean:    I've discarded my idea about creating a pre-fetch cache
2022-06-05 20:11:59.474 Dean:    
2022-06-05 15:16:20.117 Dean:    the trouble with clever people that it all comes with opinions and egos
2022-06-05 15:16:01.013 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:52:21.452 Dean:    that, to me is nothing to do with science and more to do with politix
2022-06-05 14:52:01.514 Dean:    The trouble with scientists is that they like to prove they are correct and present the 'facts' in such a way that boosts their argument
2022-06-05 14:16:02.435 Dean:    and it reads the cache size from file
2022-06-05 14:15:42.886 Dean:    it no longer clears the cache when you navigate from one folder to another
2022-06-05 14:15:06.303 Dean:    re: cacheing- I have added a refresh of the cache when the user presses the thumbnail pane refresh button
2022-06-05 14:14:15.839 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:13:52.954 Dean:    what that video DID prove was that there was no intelligence involved in the selection of fashion items work by the various people involved
2022-06-05 14:13:13.322 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:13:00.989 Dean:    to a standard that would meet his requirements
2022-06-05 14:12:41.889 Dean:    He probably hasn't yet been proven fully wrong
2022-06-05 14:12:11.312 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:12:06.607 Dean:    it is so easy to be wrong
2022-06-05 14:11:56.947 Dean:    not always a good idea to try to predict the future
2022-06-05 14:11:42.745 Dean:    That James LightHill
2022-06-05 14:11:35.957 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:11:35.528 Dean:    
2022-06-05 13:31:30.975 Dean:    and I'll set the cache size through a variable set in the config
2022-06-05 13:31:11.420 Dean:    I'm not going to worry about the oldest item in the cache
2022-06-05 13:25:09.042 Dean:    so that potential worry needs to be addressed
2022-06-05 13:24:57.315 Dean:    the user can load any image folder into the icon collection tree
2022-06-05 13:24:38.333 Dean:    to prevent the app. trying to cache a folder containing thousands of images
2022-06-05 13:24:07.349 Dean:    I think I will limit the cache to n number of items
2022-06-05 13:23:53.898 Dean:    
2022-06-05 13:22:59.446 Dean:    I'll re-test on my olde core2duo sometime
2022-06-05 13:22:32.356 Dean:    a machine that runs significantly faster in general being a desktop
2022-06-05 13:22:10.300 Dean:    it is roughly the same when running on my i7 quad core 3.0g desktop with an SSD SATA 2
2022-06-05 13:20:43.063 Dean:    whilst less than one when scrolling up
2022-06-05 13:20:21.638 Dean:    the rotating hourglass has three or four revolutions when scrolling down
2022-06-05 13:05:50.981 Dean:    a scroll up is more or less immediate
2022-06-05 13:05:32.635 Dean:    reading 12x PNGs on a scrolldown causes a delay of approx. 1/2 sec
2022-06-05 13:04:49.490 Dean:    on my laptop i7 3.3ghz dual core, four threads and SATA 2 SSD
2022-06-05 13:01:41.324 Dean:    re: cacheing
2022-06-05 13:01:33.577 Dean:    
2022-06-05 13:01:30.262 Dean:    watching it now
2022-06-05 11:09:44.058 Dean:    I'm keeping it simple
2022-06-05 11:05:33.100 Dean:    late start for me
2022-06-04 22:46:12.594 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-04 22:23:30.601 Dean:    but somehow it seems wrong just to rely on faster CPUs and SSDs
2022-06-04 22:23:13.391 Dean:    I suppose it is unnecessary on modern PCs
2022-06-04 22:09:03.962 Dean:    and learning how to optimise the reading and display of  converted images using imageLists
2022-06-04 22:08:31.654 Dean:    I am just "doing things properly"
2022-06-04 22:07:59.528 Dean:    in my old E5400 with a 5400rpm HD the delay was noticeable but still acceptable
2022-06-04 22:07:17.275 Dean:    due to hardware
2022-06-04 22:07:10.631 Dean:    so what I am optimising is really well optimised in any case
2022-06-04 22:06:53.674 Dean:    modern machines are very fast
2022-06-04 22:06:43.830 Dean:    understood
2022-06-04 22:06:40.876 Dean:    yes
2022-06-04 22:00:43.209 Dean:    but scrolling back up will be quicker
2022-06-04 22:00:28.204 Dean:    scrolling down will stilll be slower as usual
2022-06-04 21:59:54.313 Dean:    when you open an icon folder in the treeview
2022-06-04 21:59:31.495 Dean:    thinking
2022-06-04 21:38:45.205 Dean:    have to think about that
2022-06-04 21:38:39.237 Dean:    hmmm
2022-06-04 21:08:02.126 Dean:    but if it works I will be happy
2022-06-04 20:42:59.693 Dean:    I'm expecting an error
2022-06-04 20:30:27.939 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-06-04 19:44:09.362 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-06-04 19:40:24.821 Dean:    thankyou
2022-06-04 19:40:21.602 Dean:    and tell me what happens when you run the iconsettings.exe?
2022-06-04 19:40:06.618 Dean:    ie. don't put it in the program folder, at least not yet
2022-06-04 19:39:36.791 Dean:    and leave the new ocx where it is for the moment
2022-06-04 19:39:23.300 Dean:    can you please place the iconsettings.exe in the usual place
2022-06-04 19:38:54.591 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-06-04 19:38:16.978 Dean:    <><>CCRImageList.ocx
2022-06-04 18:22:41.165 Dean:    mint salad
2022-06-04 18:22:29.246 Dean:    cooked here
2022-06-04 18:22:25.775 Dean:    we had a kebab
2022-06-04 18:22:21.013 Dean:    nice
2022-06-04 15:00:08.853 Dean:    I have a timer and a routine to check idleness
2022-06-04 14:59:29.491 Dean:    figuring how I will do the advance cache-ing
2022-06-04 09:38:15.844 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-04 09:38:14.611 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-03 22:25:11.594 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-03 20:36:18.728 Dean:    the imageList is in memory and the images are smaller
2022-06-03 20:35:48.939 Dean:    it loads into an imageList using a unique key
2022-06-03 20:35:33.352 Dean:    the cacheing is effective
2022-06-03 20:35:19.497 Dean:    I have to bundle that ocx in first to remove the previous error
2022-06-03 20:34:50.808 Dean:    I may add some pre-fetching
2022-06-03 20:34:38.150 Dean:    if it is in the cache then it uses it
2022-06-03 20:34:27.445 Dean:    if you open an image and it is not in the cache then it caches it
2022-06-03 20:34:10.763 Dean:    It is not pre-emptive
2022-06-03 18:31:40.422 Dean:    ico.settings cache -in implemented!
2022-06-03 18:13:27.085 Dean:    just waved her off
2022-06-03 18:13:21.951 Dean:    wife is out on the 5K town run
2022-06-03 18:13:08.798 Dean:    England is lovely in the Summer
2022-06-03 18:12:48.796 Dean:    that looks lovely
2022-06-03 13:52:13.273 Dean:    jelly and custard
2022-06-03 12:43:00.759 Dean:    i
2022-06-03 12:42:59.118 Dean:    to clear the bran
2022-06-03 12:42:48.312 Dean:    cycled a bit today
2022-06-03 12:35:35.024 Dean:    lovely beers
2022-06-03 12:35:27.494 Dean:    picnic by the river for friends
2022-06-03 12:35:14.507 Dean:    a bit hungover
2022-06-02 22:38:24.422 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-06-02 22:38:22.924 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-06-02 22:38:21.909 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-02 19:46:01.580 Dean:    forgot to add it to the manifest
2022-06-02 19:45:46.353 Dean:    I know why
2022-06-02 19:45:41.071 Dean:    yes, understood
2022-06-02 10:06:03.190 Dean:    new version that does not need to refresh the map when dragging and dropping within the map
2022-06-02 10:05:33.172 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-06-02 10:04:47.923 Dean:    trooping now
2022-06-02 10:04:39.742 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-02 10:04:38.744 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-06-02 10:04:37.392 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-01 22:24:56.952 Dean:    TuttyByeLode

2022-06-01 22:18:01.559 Dean:    [quote] I don't much care for pop concerts. [/quote] 
2022-06-01 21:54:28.810 Dean:    love trooping
2022-06-01 21:54:23.167 Dean:    agrred
2022-06-01 21:42:57.540 Dean:    been shopping today
2022-06-01 21:42:48.801 Dean:    picnic tomorrow in the garden by the river
2022-06-01 11:57:36.038 Dean:    also trying to determine if an imageList or a dictionary is quicker to use as a cache
2022-06-01 11:57:10.677 Dean:    vb6 ico. sett debugging, very few small bugs - I am having to try hard to break it
2022-06-01 11:56:44.583 Dean:    
2022-06-01 11:25:21.456 Dean:    and drizzly
2022-06-01 11:25:16.857 Dean:    afternoon
2022-06-01 11:25:12.842 Dean:    not good morning
2022-06-01 11:25:06.943 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-01 11:25:03.101 Dean:    
2022-05-31 22:11:56.753 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-05-31 19:11:06.596 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9i47sgi-V4
2022-05-31 19:11:04.097 Dean:    
2022-05-31 18:35:09.510 Dean:    whole system with all my widgets running and the pendulum uses less than 5%
2022-05-31 18:34:37.017 Dean:    I am running it on my core i7 3.2ghz
2022-05-31 18:33:26.090 Dean:    Do you remember the old pendulum on the old steampunk clock/calendar?
2022-05-31 18:32:30.499 Dean:    
2022-05-31 17:39:16.189 Dean:    I just have to tidy up!
2022-05-31 17:39:10.077 Dean:    Lucy is making it
2022-05-31 17:39:05.118 Dean:    spag. bol here
2022-05-31 17:38:52.933 Dean:    on a percentage scale, on an average basis? or by some other metric?
2022-05-31 17:38:29.932 Dean:    [quote] I am now officially alive! [/quote] 
2022-05-31 16:58:45.886 Dean:    quite stable
2022-05-31 16:58:37.179 Dean:    just had to restart FCW, unusual
2022-05-31 16:58:27.876 Dean:    
2022-05-31 16:58:16.121 Dean:    it should be
2022-05-31 16:57:20.800 Dean:    I have to balance the cost of writing into the cache is outweighed by the speed gained from reading smaller images residing in memory
2022-05-31 16:56:35.205 Dean:    still though, a speed improvement is not to be sniffed at
2022-05-31 16:56:18.463 Dean:    but my old E5400 with 2.7ghz cpu and 5400rpm HD, the delay was significant enough to notice
2022-05-31 16:55:39.096 Dean:    very little delay
2022-05-31 16:55:26.534 Dean:    as current systems do a lot of work with little end user impact
2022-05-31 16:54:58.416 Dean:    the CPU and SSDs make this rather academic
2022-05-31 16:54:33.343 Dean:    first steps in a cache
2022-05-31 16:54:24.493 Dean:    
2022-05-31 16:54:15.982 Dean:    and there appears to be no obvious penalty whilst doing so
2022-05-31 16:53:56.690 Dean:    so far I can write the thumbnails into an imageList successfully with a unique key
2022-05-31 16:53:21.461 Dean:    I am doing some investigation on the correct structure to contain the cached images, ie. it must be fast
2022-05-31 16:52:42.574 Dean:    the dock uses a dictionary object to store the images
2022-05-31 16:52:29.736 Dean:    much the same way as the dock itself (which I did much later)
2022-05-31 16:52:12.749 Dean:    so that subsequent displays of the same icon are much quicker
2022-05-31 16:51:53.008 Dean:    I feel the need to cache them
2022-05-31 16:51:40.470 Dean:    they are all read from large PNGs and resized
2022-05-31 16:51:26.698 Dean:    when we display the 4x3 grid of thumbnails
2022-05-31 16:51:11.094 Dean:    on the ico.sett. tool
2022-05-31 16:51:09.306 Dean:    
2022-05-31 14:45:08.495 Dean:    :(
2022-05-31 14:45:02.401 Dean:    [quote] Only problem, I think we are paying for it! [/quote] 
2022-05-31 11:26:54.651 Dean:    being white they really show the dirt
2022-05-31 11:26:47.175 Dean:    just cleaned the iKeyboard again
2022-05-31 09:14:17.319 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-05-31 09:14:16.129 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-05-30 15:57:03.290 Dean:    I get so jealous
2022-05-30 15:56:59.164 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl89zm4_yKc
2022-05-30 12:36:41.759 Dean:    It is progress
2022-05-30 11:56:29.992 Dean:    There is a multiplicity of these controls
2022-05-30 11:56:08.807 Dean:    all written by the same developer
2022-05-30 11:55:57.880 Dean:     and drop in place.
2022-05-30 11:55:50.246 Dean:    all open source
2022-05-30 11:55:45.603 Dean:    His imageList is part of a set of replacement controls that can be swapped in place of the originals supplied by MS
2022-05-30 11:55:11.616 Dean:    
2022-05-30 11:55:05.116 Dean:    I am sure the original dev will work on it, he has to add the conversion from a Hbitmap to an HIcon
2022-05-30 11:54:04.064 Dean:    which is acceptable
2022-05-30 11:53:55.871 Dean:    and now it is this
2022-05-30 11:53:49.540 Dean:    <><>rdmapbug03.png
2022-05-30 11:53:45.084 Dean:    it was doing that
2022-05-30 11:53:40.468 Dean:    <><>rdmapbug02.png
2022-05-30 11:47:06.688 Dean:    it produces a white box around the dragged image rather than the transparent icon as before
2022-05-30 11:46:36.585 Dean:    .picture property rather than .image
2022-05-30 11:46:24.908 Dean:    it uses slightly different syntax, I have yet to investigate what the difference is
2022-05-30 11:46:02.303 Dean:    I have a workaround for the imageList component that I want to use to store images that now works for the drag of an icon from the map or from the thumbnail list
2022-05-30 11:45:14.992 Dean:    
2022-05-30 10:49:09.945 Dean:    just
2022-05-30 10:49:06.944 Dean:    morning!
2022-05-29 21:10:24.018 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-29 21:10:22.649 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-05-29 16:28:23.683 Dean:    Seen that
2022-05-29 15:16:23.663 Dean:    I might have to live with using one control from Microsoft
2022-05-29 14:21:43.349 Dean:    same here
2022-05-29 13:47:14.937 Dean:    it will, as always, be more complicated than it should be
2022-05-29 13:46:55.628 Dean:    I have raised an issue with the forum
2022-05-29 13:46:26.183 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:46:21.531 Dean:    conversion to a transparent ico seems to be failing
2022-05-29 13:46:00.076 Dean:    if I use the 3rd party imageList it goes wrong somewhere and the result is a black square
2022-05-29 13:45:31.098 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:45:28.991 Dean:    and that is loaded to the dragIcon
2022-05-29 13:45:20.643 Dean:    then it is transferred to an imageList that converts to a usable BMP ico
2022-05-29 13:44:43.331 Dean:    it goes from PNG in file to a picBox using GDI+ to read and render
2022-05-29 13:44:13.776 Dean:    if I use the MS supplied imageList then it loads and extracts perfectly, providing the dragIcon in the map
2022-05-29 13:43:40.645 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:43:39.224 Dean:    Now successful in build but not yet in operation
2022-05-29 13:43:18.651 Dean:    so I am trying to avoid all MS OCX and instead building my own
2022-05-29 13:42:58.660 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:42:51.544 Dean:    as they made so many changes and shipped different functionality, breaking old in the process
2022-05-29 13:42:27.577 Dean:    but relying on MS supplied versions results in DLL HELL
2022-05-29 13:42:12.128 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:42:09.195 Dean:    or you can make explicit references to your own OCX when bundling
2022-05-29 13:41:29.773 Dean:    than linking to an external OCX that may or may not be present in that version
2022-05-29 13:41:08.613 Dean:    if you can embed your own code for a control within your binary it is much safer
2022-05-29 13:40:42.197 Dean:    a replacement for the MS supplied imageList
2022-05-29 13:40:30.911 Dean:    that OLEguids was required to build a copy of an imageList tool
2022-05-29 13:40:02.010 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:39:36.515 Dean:    Lucy bought me a treat, coconut and lime ice cream - it is disgusting
2022-05-29 13:39:17.588 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:39:12.108 Dean:    compiled fine since then
2022-05-29 13:39:03.617 Dean:    and point the project references to the updated version
2022-05-29 13:38:47.354 Dean:    had to deregister the old one
2022-05-29 13:38:34.571 Dean:    OLEguids.tlb
2022-05-29 13:38:27.970 Dean:    the type library on this version of Win7 was old
2022-05-29 13:38:11.508 Dean:    vb6 ico. tool, now compiles with the external imagelist I was testing before
2022-05-29 13:28:43.348 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:28:41.538 Dean:    dealing with it now
2022-05-29 13:28:03.196 Dean:    torn tendons in elbow
2022-05-29 13:27:55.114 Dean:    eldest boy fell whilst running onto tarmac
2022-05-29 13:27:41.913 Dean:    reasonable
2022-05-29 13:27:38.580 Dean:    
2022-05-29 10:03:14.459 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-05-29 10:03:13.278 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?

2022-05-27 15:48:59.956 Dean:    moved the DLL back to the main system
2022-05-27 15:48:24.486 Dean:    Windows...

2022-05-27 15:48:03.933 Dean:    moved the same code to another system
2022-05-27 15:47:56.801 Dean:    no matter what I did, would not compile
2022-05-27 15:47:47.305 Dean:    missing a type library
2022-05-27 15:47:36.202 Dean:    it would not compile on one Windows 7 giving an error
2022-05-27 15:47:19.341 Dean:    working on some code from another dev, to provide an open source imageList plugin/DLL for my iconSettings
2022-05-27 15:46:35.076 Dean:    sunny all day
2022-05-27 15:46:32.177 Dean:    good drying washing weather

2022-05-26 21:05:24.441 Dean:    and free of nags
2022-05-26 21:05:18.766 Dean:    it is free
2022-05-26 21:04:53.984 Dean:    I use it all the time to sync between systems
2022-05-26 21:04:24.969 Dean:    it runs on linux, Mac OSX and Windows
2022-05-26 21:04:09.949 Dean:    worth a looksee
2022-05-26 21:04:04.248 Dean:    https://freefilesync.org/download.php
2022-05-26 21:03:24.798 Dean:    freefilesync - do you use it?
2022-05-26 21:03:15.183 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:50:42.408 Dean:    but at the moment it works and is largely bug free
2022-05-26 20:50:29.674 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:50:26.285 Dean:    dynamically
2022-05-26 20:50:15.625 Dean:    and rather than unloading and disposing I thought it would be better to cache the things
2022-05-26 20:49:48.582 Dean:    at the moment it only holds 12
2022-05-26 20:49:38.428 Dean:    to speed reloading up when a PNG is read into the thumbnail list
2022-05-26 20:49:03.284 Dean:    I also want to cache icons in an imported imagelist control
2022-05-26 20:48:31.732 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:48:26.972 Dean:    but there are implications
2022-05-26 20:48:11.917 Dean:    but it can be done using something called subclassing with which I am unfamilar
2022-05-26 20:47:41.812 Dean:    then I want to find out if it is easy to display the balloon tooltips over the dropdown lists, currently it is not possible
2022-05-26 20:46:48.347 Dean:    then implement "2nd app to run" after the main app.
2022-05-26 20:46:25.156 Dean:    I have to add drag and drop to the dock from the desktop
2022-05-26 20:46:10.671 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:43:32.996 Dean:    so I am going to do other projects for a while
2022-05-26 20:43:14.122 Dean:    I am a bit VB6-ed out for the moment

2022-05-26 14:13:00.969 Dean:    
2022-05-26 12:08:14.871 Dean:    The UI is working well
2022-05-26 12:08:04.480 Dean:    I will start working on the logic for creating the actual dock items next
2022-05-26 12:07:43.415 Dean:    all now working as expected
2022-05-26 12:07:36.321 Dean:    restart required
2022-05-26 12:07:31.220 Dean:    it was one of those strange bugs that affected the IDE operation
2022-05-26 12:07:11.853 Dean:    fixed that bug
2022-05-26 10:16:27.558 Dean:    so some investigation then I will give you something to test
2022-05-26 10:16:08.329 Dean:    always the way
2022-05-26 10:16:04.656 Dean:    but I have introduced a bug somewhere else!
2022-05-26 10:15:52.701 Dean:    it is now working how I want it to
2022-05-26 10:15:31.365 Dean:    I have to monitor the mouseUp/Downs
2022-05-26 10:15:14.548 Dean:    it was a pain as the dragicon was hard to control with multiple clicks on items in the found software list
2022-05-26 08:41:09.279 Dean:    tinkering with drag /drop between the lists still
2022-05-26 08:40:49.662 Dean:    
2022-05-26 08:39:07.179 Dean:    perfect outside

2022-05-25 16:50:15.092 Dean:    again, not as easy as you'd expect
2022-05-25 16:50:02.343 Dean:    generate dock util (GD) experimenting with dragging and dropping from one listbox to another
2022-05-25 16:49:28.657 Dean:    still good washing drying weather
2022-05-25 16:49:13.580 Dean:    and blowy
2022-05-25 16:49:08.812 Dean:    wispy rain
2022-05-25 16:49:04.226 Dean:    no sun at all here
2022-05-25 13:34:04.987 Dean:    I already have that code in the dock itself so I should be able to adapt it
2022-05-25 13:33:48.960 Dean:    I m intending to do the next of your suggestions, ie. drag and drop from the desktop to the map
2022-05-25 13:32:58.333 Dean:    Those are the 48x48 jpg icons that I have used in the custom msgbox that I rolled

2022-05-25 10:10:55.230 Dean:    very relaxed
2022-05-25 10:10:20.358 Dean:    New version, nothing to really note as the changes are behind the scenes, just balloon tips on the generate dock utility

2022-05-22 14:05:03.465 Dean:    nice to be making progress
2022-05-22 14:04:47.740 Dean:    all takes time if you are going to do it properly and keep it in synch
2022-05-22 14:04:25.130 Dean:    and modified descriptions to the HTML help
2022-05-22 14:03:59.111 Dean:    documented my recent code changes

2022-05-22 14:03:40.809 Dean:    lovely here
2022-05-22 10:10:33.627 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-21 22:13:01.519 Dean:    I will create some special icons to match the originals
2022-05-21 22:12:33.079 Dean:    and the constants are passed and understood
2022-05-21 22:12:20.615 Dean:    I have the message box image selection sorted
2022-05-21 22:12:08.041 Dean:    
2022-05-21 20:04:19.317 Dean:    I think all the values of  the various buttons have such a unique value individually that summing the values will always result in unique sum
2022-05-21 20:01:01.685 Dean:    can you think of a better way?
2022-05-21 20:00:51.508 Dean:    I can do it using lots of if statements
2022-05-21 20:00:37.705 Dean:    so, from the various potential values I have to determine the buttons and the image to show from the value passed
2022-05-21 20:00:08.300 Dean:    
2022-05-21 20:00:06.195 Dean:    the two together are 51
2022-05-21 19:59:55.537 Dean:    vbExclamation=48
2022-05-21 19:59:39.280 Dean:    vbYesNoCancel = 3
2022-05-21 19:59:07.926 Dean:    if I add this parameter as a vbConstant to my function it arrives as a numeric value consisting of a sum of the vbconstant values
2022-05-21 19:58:20.412 Dean:    each of those options results in a number that is delivered to the msgbox
2022-05-21 19:57:57.013 Dean:    other options might be vbInformation+vbYesNoCancel
2022-05-21 19:57:13.390 Dean:    this would produce a triangle with ana exclamation in it and also a Yes and No button
2022-05-21 19:56:37.762 Dean:    vbExclamation+vbYesNo
2022-05-21 19:56:21.242 Dean:    when I pass a vbConstant to a msgbox it is done in this manner as the second parameter
2022-05-21 19:55:40.085 Dean:    
2022-05-21 19:55:37.932 Dean:    https://flylib.com/books/en/2.688.1/section_b7_message_box_constants.html
2022-05-21 19:55:36.577 Dean:    can you look at this page?
2022-05-21 19:55:26.353 Dean:    Q. for you
2022-05-21 19:55:23.304 Dean:    
2022-05-21 15:24:47.428 Dean:    very good
2022-05-21 15:17:45.988 Dean:    the "display Info. dialogs" check box can be unselected to suppress message boxes
2022-05-21 15:17:13.384 Dean:    on the iconsettings I recently sent you...
2022-05-21 13:33:19.968 Dean:    using the most up to date version of Windows that it is practical to use.
2022-05-21 13:32:55.126 Dean:    At the moment I am unashamedly retro programming
2022-05-21 13:31:51.608 Dean:    long term stability - Linux
2022-05-21 13:31:19.099 Dean:    and realising Windows is the wrong path for developers unless you stay with Microsoft's latest and prepare for regular change/abandonment
2022-05-21 13:30:15.659 Dean:    At the moment I am banking on ReactOS for the long term
2022-05-21 13:29:45.710 Dean:    or a sandbox-in
2022-05-21 13:29:41.283 Dean:    if they implement security 'improvements' they at least need to provide an opt-out
2022-05-21 13:15:26.167 Dean:    unless they give me at the very least the option to configure back it again.
2022-05-21 13:15:00.863 Dean:    and woe betide anyone who comes in and changes it
2022-05-21 13:14:36.295 Dean:    I think of my 'puter and work environment as part of my house
2022-05-21 13:13:50.573 Dean:    whilst the host will be linux
2022-05-21 13:13:34.467 Dean:    and eventually I will sandbox those instance
2022-05-21 13:13:21.162 Dean:    and my Windows experience will be supplied by ReactOS/XP or Win7 64bit for more advanced functionality
2022-05-21 13:11:55.503 Dean:    at least the command line will be familiar
2022-05-21 13:11:46.014 Dean:    For me, I am being forced into Linux
2022-05-21 13:11:25.447 Dean:    is that it alienates in two ways
2022-05-21 13:10:58.620 Dean:    The thing about not having enough programmers and changing the UI each release without providing all the previous functionality
2022-05-21 13:10:02.324 Dean:    how crap is that?
2022-05-21 13:09:32.834 Dean:    so, Win 11 is never going to be for me
2022-05-21 13:09:17.536 Dean:    and that scuppers my use of my own dock program
2022-05-21 13:08:16.010 Dean:    the ability to place the taskbar to the top is missing with Win11
2022-05-21 13:08:01.727 Dean:    and features I need are missing from Win11
2022-05-21 13:07:37.309 Dean:    frankly there are SO many UI changes from 7 in classic mode to Win11 that for me it is like moving to another o/s altogether that happens to run some Windows programs
2022-05-21 13:06:39.489 Dean:    but ONLY when enough people complain - or avoid their latest offering
2022-05-21 13:06:21.734 Dean:    MS does often belatedly resolve the issues they resolve
2022-05-21 13:06:05.916 Dean:    until they get the hint
2022-05-21 13:05:53.366 Dean:    Well, with Microsoft's direction in general it suggests that you avoid Win11 altogether
2022-05-21 12:29:11.881 Dean:    worth a try if it knocks you out that much
2022-05-21 12:28:49.770 Dean:    Dietician might help
2022-05-21 12:28:35.660 Dean:    swines
2022-05-21 12:28:07.817 Dean:    and perhaps a word with a dietician?
2022-05-21 12:27:52.261 Dean:    might be worth bringing it up with the Doc
2022-05-21 12:20:18.088 Dean:    I am still working on the messagebox
2022-05-21 12:03:17.183 Dean:    but seems to be working
2022-05-21 12:03:05.149 Dean:    not tested in all circumstances
2022-05-21 12:02:50.889 Dean:    drag and drop from the icon images, from one part of the dock to another and hand-rolled msgbox
2022-05-21 12:02:08.494 Dean:    new iconSettings for you to test

2022-05-21 11:54:20.430 Dean:    and all the searches on t'net that might assist?
2022-05-21 11:54:04.750 Dean:    have you gone to see the Doc about that yet?

2022-05-19 20:14:07.419 Dean:    as the calendar must have been such an ephemeral concept to most
2022-05-19 20:13:35.596 Dean:    you have to be part of an advanced culture just to have people that understand it
2022-05-19 20:13:09.385 Dean:    even to come up with that calendar requires more than just memory
2022-05-19 20:12:48.242 Dean:    The Greeks were ingenious people then

2022-05-19 20:12:08.311 Dean:    and then it is time to migrate to Kubuntu I think
2022-05-19 20:11:44.688 Dean:    Win7 is my last development platform
2022-05-19 20:11:31.606 Dean:    and only then for testing
2022-05-19 20:11:25.738 Dean:    I have already decided that win10 is the last windows I will be involved with
2022-05-19 20:10:59.870 Dean:    you must be reading my mind
2022-05-19 20:10:50.326 Dean:    yes, I watched that previously

2022-05-18 13:02:33.585 Dean:    cycled 1/3rd of the way to the coast
2022-05-18 13:02:22.290 Dean:    
2022-05-18 09:18:53.849 Dean:    morning
2022-05-17 22:25:38.055 Dean:    you can try and see how it works for you
2022-05-17 22:25:26.203 Dean:    you'll see when I package it for you
2022-05-17 22:24:22.599 Dean:    that leaves the icon in the target box to only go one direction, to the left
2022-05-17 22:23:25.493 Dean:    well, if I drag from the left it means that there is a hole to the left and I fill that by moving all the icons one step to the left
2022-05-17 20:18:44.236 Dean:    rather nice
2022-05-17 20:18:38.657 Dean:    ate a pasty in the country
2022-05-17 20:18:20.282 Dean:    
2022-05-17 20:18:19.159 Dean:    cycled half way to the coast
2022-05-17 20:18:06.359 Dean:    
2022-05-17 15:24:24.847 Dean:    it provides the phone with an additional twice the capacity of its original spec. power
2022-05-17 15:22:29.589 Dean:    that is the same size as the original but a little bit deeper
2022-05-17 15:22:16.042 Dean:    I have removed the plastic holder (glued to the leather) with a sharp knife and replaced the holder with a slimline battery powerpack
2022-05-17 15:21:20.890 Dean:    I have that model in a wallet with a holder that the phone itself is placed into
2022-05-17 15:20:56.300 Dean:    re: iphone 7
2022-05-17 15:20:46.999 Dean:    
2022-05-17 15:20:18.034 Dean:    or do you want the icon currently being dragged and dropped to appear on the box before that icon?
2022-05-17 15:19:30.681 Dean:    the icon to be replaced and that icon move to the left, down one position
2022-05-17 15:19:03.682 Dean:    do you want:
2022-05-17 15:18:58.260 Dean:    and drop it on a particular box already occupied by an icon
2022-05-17 15:18:37.243 Dean:    when you, from the left, pick up an icon and slide it to the right
2022-05-17 15:18:13.245 Dean:    icon settings tool
2022-05-17 15:18:07.001 Dean:    in the map
2022-05-17 15:18:01.249 Dean:    Q. for you
2022-05-17 15:17:56.512 Dean:    
2022-05-17 10:17:18.385 Dean:    off on the ebikje for an hour or so
2022-05-16 15:41:10.013 Dean:    washing on the line, blowing well
2022-05-16 15:40:58.516 Dean:    
2022-05-16 14:02:48.820 Dean:    feeling a little 'peeky'
2022-05-16 14:02:36.749 Dean:    I'm looking a bit rough today
2022-05-16 14:02:15.763 Dean:    and I see all the pitfalls through experiencing them
2022-05-16 14:01:53.243 Dean:    so it is inevitable
2022-05-16 14:01:47.919 Dean:    and adding functionality as I learn now
2022-05-16 14:01:35.919 Dean:    I am learning to implement things as we go along
2022-05-16 14:01:22.494 Dean:    this is where a lack of design and instead building on top of something that already exists is painful
2022-05-16 14:00:49.725 Dean:    to see if I broke anything
2022-05-16 14:00:42.502 Dean:    then testing
2022-05-16 14:00:33.398 Dean:    so all those need to be amended to call a separate routine that the click event also calls
2022-05-16 14:00:12.304 Dean:    I call the click event elsewhere and that now initiates a drag operation
2022-05-16 13:59:52.565 Dean:    there are knock-on effects on normal click operations that have to be dealt with
2022-05-16 13:59:30.998 Dean:    just ensuring I have the logic all done correctly
2022-05-16 13:59:19.495 Dean:    icon settings - still implementing the drag and drop within the map
2022-05-16 11:00:04.762 Dean:    sunnyish here
2022-05-16 10:59:56.128 Dean:    Morning!

2022-05-15 19:18:48.682 Dean:    not much substance there
2022-05-15 19:18:37.134 Dean:    is this an official announcement?
2022-05-15 19:18:25.725 Dean:    looks like a load of wishful thinking to me

2022-05-15 14:34:53.890 Dean:    my simple method worked fine but was too slow using existing add and delete functions
2022-05-15 14:34:29.831 Dean:    just doing a little work on reordering the icons on an internal drag and drop in the icon map

2022-05-15 09:59:34.191 Dean:    Morning!

2022-05-14 18:40:33.842 Dean:    lovely here
2022-05-14 14:03:17.709 Dean:    but the awareness of the explicit/non-explicit type conversions is something I have to remind myself to do
2022-05-14 14:02:35.274 Dean:    I have that on all modules
2022-05-14 14:02:28.690 Dean:    vb6 requires explicit type declarations when OPTION EXPLICIT is stated at the beginning of a code module
2022-05-14 10:54:51.259 Dean:    but I forget
2022-05-14 10:54:46.750 Dean:    it is something I do try to do as I code
2022-05-14 10:54:30.052 Dean:    perhaps not important on today's 'puters but I am busily going through the code 
2022-05-14 10:54:01.115 Dean:    and if you explicitly 'type' with a $ then it is quicker
2022-05-14 10:53:35.522 Dean:    the others without $ convert from a type to a variant/object and then back again
2022-05-14 10:52:58.791 Dean:    those with the $ are explicitly string typed 
2022-05-14 10:52:41.673 Dean:    and their equivalents left$/right$/mid$
2022-05-14 10:52:26.215 Dean:    there are statements such as left/right/mid &c
2022-05-14 10:52:09.198 Dean:    just been reading about explicit typing in VB6
2022-05-14 10:51:56.661 Dean:    the chores of life

2022-05-12 11:05:22.793 Dean:    if the fans a re noisy
2022-05-12 10:54:28.461 Dean:    awkward
2022-05-12 10:54:25.307 Dean:    small one has a silly shape
2022-05-12 09:49:21.338 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-05-11 22:40:20.795 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-05-11 22:40:19.083 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-05-11 22:40:14.012 Dean:    photos please
2022-05-11 22:35:08.033 Dean:    yes I bet
2022-05-11 22:26:11.139 Dean:    wifi card?
2022-05-11 22:26:04.500 Dean:    naughty Dell
2022-05-11 22:24:04.210 Dean:    oh yes
2022-05-11 18:42:39.122 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIj3xBmALxE
2022-05-11 09:31:50.033 Dean:    but email is not required for what I need it for
2022-05-11 09:31:38.107 Dean:     I could try various providers
2022-05-11 09:31:16.833 Dean:    probably security issues
2022-05-11 09:31:05.316 Dean:    cannot get mail to work on it though, not to the email servers I have access to
2022-05-11 09:30:19.538 Dean:    I might get another year on 3G
2022-05-11 09:30:08.349 Dean:    3G only - that will be gone from here soon enough
2022-05-11 09:29:53.307 Dean:    no SIM
2022-05-11 09:29:42.173 Dean:    without a connection
2022-05-11 09:29:33.277 Dean:    searches down to the postcode
2022-05-11 09:29:23.917 Dean:    nice to have a common tool
2022-05-11 09:29:14.134 Dean:    as I know the interface and its quirks
2022-05-11 09:28:55.349 Dean:    but I use navmii across all devices
2022-05-11 09:28:44.172 Dean:    I have it
2022-05-11 09:28:33.892 Dean:    the case is now rugged too
2022-05-11 09:28:22.654 Dean:    so, for £20 or so you can have a fully functioning bike console with 32gb of storage
2022-05-11 09:27:43.900 Dean:    GPS yup
2022-05-11 09:27:34.394 Dean:    directions, maps, speeds, music, dynamic night sky map, compass, weather, video camera when cycling, alarms for the home return  deadline, and internet access when on wifi in the pub
2022-05-11 09:25:10.114 Dean:    but it has transformed it into a perfect ebike console
2022-05-11 09:24:48.402 Dean:    (must be careful)
2022-05-11 09:24:39.949 Dean:    that can pair and provide me with background music when cycling
2022-05-11 09:24:25.071 Dean:    and a set of bluetooth headphones
2022-05-11 09:23:55.969 Dean:    I bought a £8 3000mWh battery that keeps it charged for ages and it has a solar panel on the back
2022-05-11 09:23:18.687 Dean:    the main issue was the battery drain
2022-05-11 09:23:11.553 Dean:    it is turning out to be a very useful device
2022-05-11 09:22:49.832 Dean:    I have found a very useful task for that old iphone as described (on the ebike as a console)
2022-05-11 09:22:14.430 Dean:    
2022-05-11 09:22:03.926 Dean:    recovering?
2022-05-11 09:21:59.938 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-05-11 09:21:53.559 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-05-10 10:10:55.437 Dean:    just trying to laugh...
2022-05-10 10:10:40.117 Dean:    oh bugger!
2022-05-10 10:09:46.376 Dean:    the old jokes are the worst
2022-05-10 10:09:39.454 Dean:    [quote] They no longer say "just a little prick" when you get the vaccine, etc. [/quote] 
2022-05-10 10:09:05.894 Dean:    not another endoscopy?
2022-05-10 10:09:00.994 Dean:    thjis is just the booster then
2022-05-10 10:08:48.223 Dean:    so embarassing
2022-05-10 10:08:35.590 Dean:    somethings you never forget
2022-05-10 10:01:16.094 Dean:    and it was a new and an embarassing experience for both of us
2022-05-10 10:00:55.349 Dean:    she was extremely gorgeous
2022-05-10 10:00:45.497 Dean:    I remember having to show my genitals (due to a fungal rash) to a brabd new doctor on her first day as a Doctor straight from college
2022-05-10 09:59:51.884 Dean:    but those people do it every day
2022-05-10 09:59:36.131 Dean:    it just lacks dignity
2022-05-10 09:59:24.710 Dean:    but I hope it is not too awful an experience
2022-05-10 09:59:08.068 Dean:    I can't say "have fun"
2022-05-10 09:39:11.832 Dean:    tired
2022-05-10 09:39:10.392 Dean:    yawning
2022-05-10 09:39:04.617 Dean:

2022-05-10 09:38:45.431 Dean:    Hello!
2022-05-09 22:31:13.589 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-09 22:31:09.866 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire

2022-05-09 12:46:19.829 Dean:    I use it instead of  Wondows (sic) search as you know
2022-05-09 12:45:47.478 Dean:    I find it useful from time to time
2022-05-09 12:45:37.611 Dean:    under Windows, Effective file search has an option to not just find files but specific matching text in files
2022-05-09 12:44:54.314 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:44:18.344 Dean:    waste of time
2022-05-09 12:44:11.457 Dean:    I spent a good hour planning it and writing it in pseudo code
2022-05-09 12:43:37.058 Dean:    It is

2022-05-09 12:25:19.152 Dean:    that is why it is good to have a store of code I suppose
2022-05-09 12:25:01.785 Dean:    you cannot even learn from your own mistakes and solutions...
2022-05-09 12:24:12.884 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:24:10.138 Dean:    How frustrating it is to realise that you can't teach an old dog new tricks
2022-05-09 12:23:48.786 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:23:47.917 Dean:    that there was an easier approach
2022-05-09 12:23:35.594 Dean:    I had done the same and had the same realisation
2022-05-09 12:23:17.867 Dean:    then I realised I had already had this whole train of thought when I created the earlier version
2022-05-09 12:22:47.591 Dean:    and that I had taken the more efficient route last time
2022-05-09 12:22:29.279 Dean:    so, I did that and realised there was much more efficient and incredibly easy method that  would takje 5 minutes and need no planning
2022-05-09 12:21:44.136 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:21:41.394 Dean:    then I realised I had done something similar before and that I ought to look at it and perhaps take that code or that method at least
2022-05-09 12:21:02.429 Dean:    and commented it properly ensuring I really thought about what was required
2022-05-09 12:20:42.855 Dean:    I wrote out the spec in pseudo code
2022-05-09 12:20:24.955 Dean:    rather than me
2022-05-09 12:20:17.730 Dean:    trying to act more like you
2022-05-09 12:20:08.624 Dean:    I have just been doing some planning prior to writing some code
2022-05-09 12:19:52.756 Dean:    
2022-05-09 11:56:45.747 Dean:    mint humbugs are a good thing to starve upon
2022-05-09 11:56:24.999 Dean:    
2022-05-09 11:56:19.340 Dean:    feeling my age a bit here
2022-05-09 11:56:11.275 Dean:    as none of us are getting any younger
2022-05-09 11:55:58.956 Dean:    but I thought it might be useful to raise it
2022-05-09 11:55:40.541 Dean:    a ridiculous conversation
2022-05-09 11:55:31.580 Dean:    
2022-05-09 11:55:15.772 Dean:    I am unsure anyone will care for my creations 
2022-05-09 11:54:56.738 Dean:    and I will carry on with it, giving you credit of course!
2022-05-09 11:54:37.497 Dean:    u
2022-05-09 11:54:35.339 Dean:    I'll make sire your code continues to exist
2022-05-09 11:54:23.269 Dean:    regardless of what happens
2022-05-09 11:54:13.805 Dean:    as I will look after it for you
2022-05-09 11:54:03.181 Dean:    then make sure I have all your code
2022-05-09 11:53:49.308 Dean:    I know this is a sensitive subject but if you ever feel that the medical buggers aren't looking after you and you feel you are failing...
2022-05-09 11:52:08.178 Dean:    better than the other end
2022-05-09 11:49:56.374 Dean:    ?
2022-05-09 11:49:54.397 Dean:    which end
2022-05-09 11:49:50.371 Dean:    poor you
2022-05-09 11:47:36.004 Dean:    as a trial
2022-05-09 11:47:31.119 Dean:    When I manage to obtain a Win10/11 machine I will join you with the web widgets
2022-05-09 11:46:48.511 Dean:    Send me screenshots as you manage to populate it with converted widgets
2022-05-09 10:58:37.896 Dean:    the widgets look best on my laptop
2022-05-09 10:58:26.272 Dean:    slow migration from YWE

2022-05-09 08:42:55.963 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-08 16:16:56.391 Dean:    The Worsley woman makes a few good documentaries
2022-05-08 16:15:47.683 Dean:    
2022-05-08 15:52:52.284 Dean:    I hope for more
2022-05-08 15:52:04.032 Dean:     occasional documentaries restore my faith
2022-05-08 15:51:50.814 Dean:    I used to love the BBC
2022-05-08 15:51:21.234 Dean:    and leave the social engineering behind
2022-05-08 15:51:02.192 Dean:    Kids programmes & documentaries
2022-05-08 15:50:40.643 Dean:    News and British films/drama
2022-05-08 15:50:23.757 Dean:    I think the BBC needs to refocus
2022-05-08 15:50:06.411 Dean:    radio 4 and youtube are my main places now
2022-05-08 15:49:42.142 Dean:    so it seems I am being transferred to the radio
2022-05-08 15:49:25.085 Dean:    I am white, middle class and in my 60s...
2022-05-08 15:49:08.192 Dean:    but the BBC is not for me now
2022-05-08 15:48:58.080 Dean:    plus a bit of music
2022-05-08 15:48:52.731 Dean:    documentaries and factual telly
2022-05-08 15:48:41.260 Dean:    I love intelligent dramas and histories
2022-05-08 15:48:17.200 Dean:    and is too politically correct for me to bear
2022-05-08 15:48:05.256 Dean:    I think it has dumbed down a few levels too far
2022-05-08 15:47:49.908 Dean:    used to be my channel of choice
2022-05-08 15:47:40.879 Dean:    almost none
2022-05-08 15:47:36.291 Dean:    I'm watching a lot less BBC these days
2022-05-08 15:47:00.117 Dean:    Later, I might add the code from SteamyDock that enables drag from the desktop to the map
2022-05-08 15:45:58.966 Dean:    ico settings tool - dragging from the dock now requires a mouseDown for x no. of ms before a drag is recognised - working well
2022-05-08 11:54:13.013 Dean:    any side effects from the jabs?
2022-05-08 11:53:55.366 Dean:    Good Afternoon!

2022-05-07 18:47:05.565 Dean:    Sounds good
2022-05-07 15:01:43.964 Dean:    then it is all new functionality, the auto-generation utility &c
2022-05-07 15:01:18.369 Dean:    one positioning fix to apply on the drop-down section
2022-05-07 15:00:54.872 Dean:    but I seem to have worked my way through them all
2022-05-07 15:00:38.777 Dean:    impossible I know
2022-05-07 15:00:33.397 Dean:    As far as I know, there are no bugs in iconSettings.exe
2022-05-07 15:00:12.432 Dean:    
2022-05-07 15:00:10.965 Dean:    so you can re-order easily
2022-05-07 15:00:00.775 Dean:    I am adding drag and drop within the map itself
2022-05-07 14:59:46.526 Dean:    very good
2022-05-07 14:59:44.016 Dean:    
2022-05-07 14:44:12.371 Dean:    not in any way important
2022-05-07 14:44:03.810 Dean:    when you next get a chance please test that iconsettings.exe

2022-05-06 18:18:13.954 Dean:    you have no time at all now to spare
2022-05-06 16:40:18.979 Dean:    did she walk into something, I've done that
2022-05-06 16:40:01.134 Dean:    how did that happen?

2022-05-06 09:50:24.612 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-05 22:37:24.477 Dean:    and what with the delay with the click registering on the icon and stuff happening it seems to be about right
2022-05-05 22:36:57.034 Dean:    I tried various timings
2022-05-05 18:06:47.456 Dean:    all other clicks are just like normal, the drag requiring the briefest pause
2022-05-05 18:06:22.323 Dean:    so I added a timer, that counts to 50ms and if the mouseDown is still active after that period then the drag starts and the dragIcon appears
2022-05-05 18:05:32.958 Dean:    as it annoys
2022-05-05 18:05:29.048 Dean:    I don't want it to appear immediately on every click
2022-05-05 18:05:08.018 Dean:    iconSettings - the VB6 drag mode annoyed me, the second you mouseDown on a control the dragIcon appeared
2022-05-05 17:58:51.804 Dean:    strange to have a power cut these days in the middle of England
2022-05-05 17:58:20.224 Dean:    I see

2022-05-05 08:49:46.206 Dean:    doing some underlying tuning/bugfixing/rejigging

2022-05-04 18:20:54.765 Dean:    good progress
2022-05-04 13:40:54.044 Dean:    making that operate correctly now

2022-05-04 09:33:12.049 Dean:    just testin and modifying the help
2022-05-04 09:33:00.568 Dean:    fixed the drag/drop
2022-05-04 09:32:49.444 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?

2022-05-03 23:22:00.063 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-03 10:13:42.594 Dean:    an old friend from Australia
2022-05-03 10:13:32.700 Dean:    off out shortly

2022-05-02 23:17:04.138 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-02 17:09:33.921 Dean:    cut the lawn with the min tractor
2022-05-02 10:50:51.579 Dean:    As you can change several via the drag and drop I have to change the process
2022-05-02 10:39:29.816 Dean:    dragging the icon to the dock is just the 'potential' of an icon image change
2022-05-02 10:39:03.196 Dean:    I may amend the pop up to say press SET
2022-05-02 10:38:32.209 Dean:    but I will have to find a change or two to suit the new operation expectations
2022-05-02 10:38:09.194 Dean:    but there is normal operation to press Set to make it semi stick
2022-05-02 10:37:05.038 Dean:    Part the way through
2022-05-02 10:36:50.421 Dean:    yes I saw that

2022-05-02 10:06:44.199 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-01 23:50:38.317 Dean:    I will amend the help with the various changes made recently
2022-05-01 23:50:25.782 Dean:    something for you to test tomorrow
2022-05-01 23:50:16.006 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-05-01 22:26:30.133 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-05-01 19:17:27.893 Dean:    I will add the code to drop it onto the map
2022-05-01 19:17:15.903 Dean:    good
2022-05-01 18:25:51.132 Dean:    I am using a new control that exists inside a MS OCX (dll)
2022-05-01 18:25:24.787 Dean:    please test at your leisure and let me know if there is an issue
2022-05-01 18:24:57.702 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-05-01 18:00:45.471 Dean:    
2022-05-01 18:00:43.759 Dean:    but I should have the drag and drop to the dock working by tomorrow if I have more coding time tomorrow
2022-05-01 18:00:16.199 Dean:    we'll have to see about that later
2022-05-01 18:00:08.213 Dean:    I will have to add some  simple animation to the dock to allow an extra box to appear or similar
2022-05-01 17:59:34.887 Dean:    soon
2022-05-01 17:59:32.122 Dean:    so drag and drop from the thumbnails to the map will be implemented
2022-05-01 17:59:03.708 Dean:    I should have the drop handled shortly
2022-05-01 17:58:54.923 Dean:    I have the icon selected, the drag handled, the drag icon is shown correctly (impressively so) and the drop event is registered
2022-05-01 17:58:09.994 Dean:    
2022-05-01 16:01:23.913 Dean:    
2022-05-01 16:01:21.301 Dean:    an icon drags successfully , I just need to capture and handle the drop
2022-05-01 16:00:52.574 Dean:    I have moved it to to the dragDrop event where it is run instead
2022-05-01 15:59:59.226 Dean:    not as easy as you would expect as dadding drag acapability to an icon disables both its click and mousedown events
2022-05-01 15:59:30.823 Dean:    adding drag and drop to the map
2022-05-01 15:59:20.922 Dean:    I have implmented one of your suggestions, partially in the iconSettings tool
2022-05-01 15:58:59.748 Dean:    
2022-05-01 14:55:33.529 Dean:    tidying up after yourself is vital!
2022-05-01 14:55:17.009 Dean:    anyway, done now
2022-05-01 14:55:03.627 Dean:    the issue was unfortunately obscured by various .setFocus to different controls and using a slider to store the main value
2022-05-01 14:53:51.967 Dean:    logging helped me find it
2022-05-01 14:39:32.884 Dean:    Doesn't it annoy you when a single one-line bug takes two days of your coding time to find and resolve?
2022-05-01 14:38:54.819 Dean:    
2022-05-01 14:31:29.376 Dean:    but the methof tracking down was complex involving add ing timers that set focus to specific controls to avoid clicking upon them
2022-05-01 14:30:52.655 Dean:    in the end the bug was trivial
2022-05-01 14:30:37.140 Dean:    which mde it hard to debug since each exit to the IDE changed the focus to the IDE
2022-05-01 14:30:11.539 Dean:    it was all on mousedowns and keydown events
2022-05-01 14:29:58.972 Dean:    during previous testing I added a line that bu"@@ered the logic
2022-05-01 14:29:34.162 Dean:    and it was my fault
2022-05-01 14:29:27.194 Dean:    found it
2022-05-01 14:29:24.712 Dean:    I had a real bugger of a bug to find
2022-05-01 10:01:39.071 Dean:    Deep sleep - still very tired

2022-04-30 21:38:04.306 Dean:    a little bit of coding

2022-04-25 13:06:49.937 Dean:    and a little coding to smarten it
2022-04-25 13:06:42.180 Dean:    just some thinking 
2022-04-25 13:06:35.996 Dean:    much better now and usable

2022-04-24 12:35:00.734 Dean:    on Quora you are engaging with paid trolls, idiots and people who are paid to generate stupid questions, they probably employ a gaggle of semi-stupid people

2022-04-23 11:30:50.421 Dean:    The Dell laptop has a surprisingly good wifi
2022-04-23 11:30:37.183 Dean:    This house is spread out and the walls are thick
2022-04-23 11:24:31.949 Dean:

2022-04-21 12:46:44.122 Dean:    and it wraps around the iphone and makes it shock resistant

2022-04-21 12:45:23.935 Dean:    the old battery inside the phone doesn't last long now so it was a toss up as to changing the battery £50 or another iphone 4s with a better battery at the same price

2022-04-16 13:19:19.252 Dean:    this allows you to play full screen apps or games that do not wnat to share screenspace
2022-04-16 13:18:45.357 Dean:    if the app has gone then the dock reveals itself
2022-04-16 13:18:29.252 Dean:    SD stores the app name that hid it and checks every 1.5 secs as to whether it is  still running
2022-04-16 13:17:52.132 Dean:    when the app runs, the dock hides
2022-04-16 13:17:41.676 Dean:    added a forceReveal to the dock when it has been forceHidden by an app that has that flag set

2022-04-15 22:08:03.067 Dean:    the trouble is with those sort of bookkeeping tasks they can take hours to get just right
2022-04-15 22:07:37.187 Dean:    it balanced
2022-04-15 22:07:32.982 Dean:    just moved it and removed the duplicate, fixed the errors and all well

2022-04-15 22:06:31.394 Dean:    she had made a few minor errors in calculations
2022-04-15 22:06:15.827 Dean:    so I just itemised everything in tthe sheet and made it balance
2022-04-15 22:05:53.188 Dean:    and she was struggling making it balance
2022-04-15 22:05:41.091 Dean:    Lucy is the named person on the order
2022-04-15 22:04:37.586 Dean:    the report had to balance exactly and was itemised according to category and type of expenditure and income

2022-04-13 20:01:20.472 Dean:    I do not have a clue how I made that occur
2022-04-13 20:01:09.707 Dean:    but it would be very useful if it existed
2022-04-13 20:01:00.641 Dean:    I cannot reproduce
2022-04-13 19:59:38.363 Dean:     but there isn't one
2022-04-13 19:59:30.702 Dean:    it was as if a "hide all widgets" option had been clicked
2022-04-13 19:59:09.399 Dean:    I clicked on a widget in the dashboard and it appeared
2022-04-13 19:58:53.186 Dean:    but none could be seen
2022-04-13 19:58:13.333 Dean:    the dashboard was still there and the widgest were all running
2022-04-13 19:57:56.274 Dean:    just all gone
2022-04-13 19:57:51.764 Dean:    not heads - up display

2022-04-13 19:57:15.493 Dean:    I did something strange
2022-04-13 19:57:09.048 Dean:

2022-04-13 16:49:17.690 Dean:    
2022-04-13 15:06:45.875 Dean:    if you know of any useful off-the-shelf switchable circuits
2022-04-13 15:06:24.635 Dean:    and I want something that does the job
2022-04-13 15:06:12.418 Dean:    should be a couple of transistors and a resistor or two but PCB design skills are minimal
2022-04-13 15:05:14.652 Dean:    to control indicators
2022-04-13 15:05:07.006 Dean:    that I can put in a small box on my bike
2022-04-13 15:04:52.324 Dean:    I need a flasher unit for LED bulbs, low voltage
2022-04-13 15:04:34.604 Dean:    I was thinking about asking you to develop a simple circuit for me
2022-04-13 15:04:17.063 Dean:    
2022-04-13 15:04:07.436 Dean:    enjoyed the bug fixing

2022-04-13 11:05:28.603 Dean:    I try to avoid using it hence win 7
2022-04-13 11:05:05.868 Dean:    and MS is always mucking about with them, trying to make them difficult to set up locally, forcing you to move to online account log on &c
2022-04-13 11:04:09.711 Dean:    when you experience a complete profile loss it will change the way you work
2022-04-13 11:03:52.859 Dean:    
2022-04-13 11:03:36.599 Dean:    as they were implemented by different teams from the chaps that built the core o/s
2022-04-13 11:03:18.646 Dean:    I do not trust these additional things that MS bolted onto Windows
2022-04-13 11:02:57.657 Dean:    all have lost files, synch'd incorrectly &c
2022-04-13 11:02:44.221 Dean:    In the past I have had sync. issues with briefcase, onedrive and the profile
2022-04-13 11:01:56.865 Dean:    just on the file system
2022-04-13 11:01:50.793 Dean:    and never in any MS structures
2022-04-13 11:01:38.544 Dean:    my files all reside on a separate data disc away from the C: drive
2022-04-13 11:01:18.929 Dean:    the downloads are redirected elsewhere
2022-04-13 11:01:03.841 Dean:    
2022-04-13 11:00:59.987 Dean:    p

2022-04-13 11:00:50.856 Dean:    that is why I have multiple systems with the date
2022-04-13 11:00:39.591 Dean:     I have experienced it twice
2022-04-13 11:00:25.388 Dean:    and it does get corrupted
2022-04-13 11:00:14.981 Dean:    it seems to store its own indepndent file table for all files that reside under the profile
2022-04-13 10:59:41.883 Dean:    and if it is corrupted then all the files are dtill present but all will have 0 byte sizes and appear empty
2022-04-13 10:59:07.428 Dean:    the profile is a database with links to the actual location on the disc
2022-04-13 10:58:43.623 Dean:    where ALL data under the profile was lost
2022-04-13 10:58:29.689 Dean:    reason for this is a couple of catastrophic losses
2022-04-13 10:58:15.600 Dean:    I have no files under my documents &c
2022-04-13 10:57:59.339 Dean:    and it resides on an area away from the user profile
2022-04-13 10:57:46.263 Dean:    I always have a separate folder named DEAN
2022-04-13 10:57:31.204 Dean:    if you have your data and images, files &c under the profile then move them
2022-04-13 10:57:08.340 Dean:    FYI do not store any data under the user profile
2022-04-13 10:56:55.234 Dean:

2022-04-12 18:29:52.515 Dean:    and perhaps those cables at the bottom...
2022-04-12 18:29:37.672 Dean:    I am going to add a dialog box with a check box to go away for ever... to suppress the regular pop ups when Dropbox is not there

2022-04-11 15:51:48.668 Dean:    need to test the command first though on XP and Win 7 to see if it works
2022-04-11 15:51:19.400 Dean:    the signal will simply call a command line command to disable networking

2022-04-01 19:10:24.973 Dean:    done now

2022-04-01 11:33:05.271 Dean:    agreed
2022-04-01 11:26:32.291 Dean:    when I saw the Russians invading on at least seven fronts it was clear that they had made a miscalculation based upon over confidence and self belief, also fragmentation of command
2022-04-01 11:25:32.757 Dean:    all their plans seem to be short sighted and lacking even basic competence
2022-04-01 11:25:01.643 Dean:    but it feels if they are a little bu@@ered either way
2022-04-01 11:24:23.965 Dean:    I think the Russkis wanted to temporarily improve the strength of the rouble in its dire need
2022-04-01 11:23:41.898 Dean:    
2022-04-01 11:22:34.196 Dean:    I have added HEIC and HEIF to the listy of valid but unknown image types for FCW
2022-04-01 11:22:10.684 Dean:    does not allow VB6 to read them but a dbl click will open the photo viewer app that now recognises them
2022-04-01 11:21:43.332 Dean:    it appears to be a Codec that allows win7 to view HEIC files using win native tools
2022-04-01 11:21:10.075 Dean:    I installed copyTrans for windows that handles HEIC files
2022-04-01 09:30:38.811 Dean:    nothing at all in the news

2022-03-31 20:43:48.662 Dean:    so cheap
2022-03-31 14:58:31.100 Dean:    and then Windows can display it afterwards
2022-03-31 14:58:20.309 Dean:    for the moment I can enable it for a double click
2022-03-31 14:58:02.197 Dean:    they have a partial solution already, I just need to wait until it is mature!
2022-03-31 14:57:43.173 Dean:    I will hang around watching the VB6 users come up with a solution - it is on-going now
2022-03-31 14:57:19.133 Dean:    [quote] That's an installer for Pixillion which can convert images - free to use for home users. [/quote]

2022-03-31 09:47:19.026 Dean:    some people are making in-roads to reading them but the format is new to windows and still alien to VB natively.
2022-03-31 09:45:41.726 Dean:    HEIF files are not yet readable in VB6
2022-03-30 20:50:12.106 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire

2022-03-30 17:08:02.451 Dean:    I was calculating the form width properly but in the meantime MS changed everything again
2022-03-30 17:07:33.874 Dean:    the API gives a negative border width for some reason
2022-03-30 17:07:16.498 Dean:    they are mere templates on top of another window making regions invisible
2022-03-30 17:06:59.226 Dean:    on Win10 there are hidden borders and there is an API that has to be called to determine the width of these, they vary depending upon the aero theme type and some of them are also invisible
2022-03-30 17:05:41.340 Dean:    that worked well for XP - win 7
2022-03-30 17:05:23.041 Dean:    and scaleWidth which is just the form minus the borders
2022-03-30 17:05:02.982 Dean:    VB6 has width which incorporates the inner form and the exterior border

2022-03-30 10:44:23.226 Dean:    so obvious nd so silly
2022-03-30 10:44:12.003 Dean:    I have moved my no duplicates code to after the unlock
2022-03-30 10:43:52.319 Dean:    the code was running but its effects were not seen as I had a lockupdate command set previously that was not unlocked until after my code was run
2022-03-30 10:42:53.947 Dean:    and I realised that although I had code to prevent any seemingly duplicated lines (in reality remnants of the previous update that had not yet been over written)
2022-03-30 10:41:51.247 Dean:    I was still seeing an occasional duplication
2022-03-30 10:41:40.205 Dean:    re: duplication in FCW
2022-03-30 10:41:32.122 Dean:    
2022-03-30 10:41:18.250 Dean:    will you post your factoring code somewhere?
2022-03-30 10:40:34.515 Dean:    it is handling it well
2022-03-30 09:55:28.606 Dean:    at your leisure
2022-03-30 09:54:08.829 Dean:    I want to see what happens at this end
2022-03-30 09:53:56.708 Dean:    just two lines or so
2022-03-30 09:53:47.447 Dean:    H. could you do some very minor housekeeping? move some of he oldest data from your output file?
2022-03-30 09:49:04.154 Dean:     Windspeed is 6 knots, force 2, direction SE

2022-03-29 21:57:02.006 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-03-29 21:56:55.829 Dean:    what you see is  not what you get
2022-03-29 21:56:34.213 Dean:    it seems there are hidden borders in win 10 and above
2022-03-29 21:50:20.931 Dean:    VERY useful

2022-03-29 21:42:16.425 Dean:    but we shall see
2022-03-29 21:42:11.828 Dean:    This should report the values of the borders under win10
2022-03-29 21:39:51.528 Dean:    thankyou#
2022-03-29 21:39:43.693 Dean:    please click on the little bevelled cover and report the values returned
2022-03-29 21:39:07.922 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2022-03-29 18:04:44.992 Dean:    supposedly a full charge costs approx 5-10p
2022-03-29 17:30:41.168 Dean:    it makes cycling 100% easier, more fun and you get somewhere very quickly so you go much further
2022-03-29 17:30:09.420 Dean:    (well not really but you get my drift)
2022-03-29 17:29:52.872 Dean:    in effect having 50%  stronger legs
2022-03-29 17:29:36.044 Dean:    providing 50% of the motive energy really helps the range of the bike
2022-03-29 17:29:08.692 Dean:    from a standard plug
2022-03-29 17:28:59.607 Dean:    possible less
2022-03-29 17:28:53.373 Dean:    but typically I observe charge times of 4-6hrs
2022-03-29 17:28:26.716 Dean:    recharging overnight, so I am unaware of exactly hw long it takes
2022-03-29 17:26:43.964 Dean:    this 36v battery is rated at 15Ah so 540wH so 1,944,000 joules?
2022-03-29 17:23:48.716 Dean:    typically 3.4kg
2022-03-29 17:02:04.531 Dean:    and the fact that I am still providing 50% of the motive effort
2022-03-29 17:01:45.531 Dean:    just me and the lightweight (in comparison to a car)
2022-03-29 17:01:20.716 Dean:    What makes the batteries on the eBike so good is that they have so little to move
2022-03-29 14:18:29.107 Dean:    I will analyse
2022-03-29 14:18:18.843 Dean:    perfect
2022-03-29 14:17:19.467 Dean:    oops

2022-03-29 12:10:38.594 Dean:    and report the two values
2022-03-29 12:10:30.771 Dean:    press that please
2022-03-29 12:10:13.843 Dean:    you can just see it in the gap between the hlep button and the right hand border
2022-03-29 12:09:40.379 Dean:    is a small hidden panel
2022-03-29 12:09:31.602 Dean:    next to the HELP button on the right

2022-03-29 11:52:31.219 Dean:    I will add some code that returns a value for certain items
2022-03-29 11:52:14.970 Dean:    right
2022-03-29 11:52:13.354 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:42:18.531 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:42:14.829 Dean:    so I need an external DVD drive for those bits of software that require physical medium (DRM with physical drive checks)
2022-03-29 11:40:56.743 Dean:    replacing them with 1/2TB HDs
2022-03-29 11:40:45.918 Dean:    I have removed all my internal DVD/CDs from the various laptops
2022-03-29 11:40:24.595 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:40:22.023 Dean:    to allow me to do this
2022-03-29 11:40:11.303 Dean:    so I have a external CD drive coming
2022-03-29 11:39:59.375 Dean:    I still prefer installing from CD
2022-03-29 11:39:42.647 Dean:    but I will soon
2022-03-29 11:39:37.798 Dean:    not yet
2022-03-29 11:39:28.471 Dean:    my newer laptop does not have these .NET versions installed
2022-03-29 11:38:46.321 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:38:42.645 Dean:    as that was too much work for little old me
2022-03-29 11:38:29.048 Dean:    then stopped keeping it up to date with the VB6 version
2022-03-29 11:38:14.146 Dean:    and then stopped development when I managed to get it to a point where it worked
2022-03-29 11:37:48.643 Dean:    I built that on my old laptop
2022-03-29 11:37:29.850 Dean:    and which I used to build the .NET version of  the Rocketdock enhanced icon editor utility
2022-03-29 11:36:54.524 Dean:    those are the early .NET versions that have a built-in migrator (rubbish but useful) from VB6
2022-03-29 11:36:15.589 Dean:    just installed vb 2008 and 2010 on my desktop
2022-03-29 10:18:23.202 Dean:    I have  some thoughts
2022-03-29 10:18:16.898 Dean:    if not ( I suspect it is still there) then we will do some research on why it is there
2022-03-29 10:17:54.154 Dean:    when you try it on your DEll see if ithas resolved the 'gap' issue on the right hand side of the screen
2022-03-29 10:17:01.826 Dean:    but plenty resolved too
2022-03-29 10:16:50.378 Dean:    plenty of bugs and unknown issues
2022-03-29 10:16:34.994 Dean:    ver 2018

2022-03-29 10:15:56.099 Dean:    I will address this at the very end
2022-03-29 10:15:34.546 Dean:    yes the 96dpi is common
2022-03-29 09:23:58.994 Dean:    though I havce some code to do the former
2022-03-29 09:23:28.963 Dean:    It will have to wait until the end
2022-03-29 09:23:20.007 Dean:    
2022-03-29 09:23:09.810 Dean:    have alternative versions of the imagery for each level of DPI increase
2022-03-29 09:22:43.578 Dean:    or
2022-03-29 09:22:40.826 Dean:    losing some of the imagery clarity
2022-03-29 09:22:23.482 Dean:    when the DPI setting is changed I need to reload all the imagery associated with the UI and resize dynamically
2022-03-29 09:21:51.538 Dean:    It is a right pain
2022-03-29 09:17:37.115 Dean:    seeing what I need to do to scale the imagery
2022-03-29 09:17:18.244 Dean:    testing FCW with high DPI screens

2022-03-28 18:30:11.302 Dean:    
2022-03-28 18:30:08.782 Dean:    hmmmm
2022-03-28 18:19:30.925 Dean:    Xwidgets would have been a close runner if it had matured
2022-03-28 18:19:07.310 Dean:    and still nothing as good to replace it
2022-03-28 17:44:25.174 Dean:    that was 2014
2022-03-28 17:44:19.118 Dean:    still good after all this time

2022-03-28 14:06:11.773 Dean:    Beedell
2022-03-28 13:58:31.717 Dean:    to fox the nasty NAzis in case they broadcast their own news with their own broadcasters
2022-03-28 13:58:06.652 Dean:    The first chap to say his name and who was reading the news
2022-03-28 13:57:43.397 Dean:    He did all the news reading during the 1940s
2022-03-28 13:57:10.501 Dean:    Who spoke very much in that fashion
2022-03-28 13:56:55.237 Dean:    Trying to sound like Alvar Liddel
2022-03-28 13:55:15.869 Dean:     Windspeed is 2 knots, force 1, direction N

2022-03-28 13:50:52.252 Dean:    the third has some muted sound at the end
2022-03-28 13:50:00.524 Dean:    Windows did not like the first of those three
2022-03-28 13:49:50.172 Dean:    hmm
2022-03-28 13:44:14.256 Dean:    they aren't real buttons in the VB6 sense but are just images.
2022-03-28 13:43:42.109 Dean:    also, gave the three top main buttons some 'life', they move when depressed and released
2022-03-28 13:42:52.451 Dean:    Coding - polished the themeing and the abaility to switch from dark to high contrast, save the setting and have it re-enabled on next run

2022-03-28 13:15:43.421 Dean:    She has a lisp
2022-03-28 11:19:44.427 Dean:    as in Ye Olde Englifhe?

2022-03-27 18:21:33.123 Dean:    but it does the job
2022-03-27 18:21:21.818 Dean:    yes, rather
2022-03-27 18:09:12.867 Dean:    but Lucy has resisted it and is tested twice per week
2022-03-27 18:08:52.562 Dean:    well,  Red had it two weeks ago
2022-03-27 18:07:45.323 Dean:    she has slept all day
2022-03-27 18:07:40.311 Dean:    but suppressing it does not help you get over it
2022-03-27 18:07:28.787 Dean:    she has been working through it
2022-03-27 18:07:19.733 Dean:    suffering under this cough
2022-03-27 18:07:12.545 Dean:    Lucy is unwell
2022-03-27 18:07:04.943 Dean:    same here but with chilli con carne
2022-03-27 18:04:21.714 Dean:    that's very good and very true.

2022-03-25 23:27:12.466 Dean:    trying to cure a bad cough that we all have here at the moment
2022-03-25 23:26:53.961 Dean:    no alcohol
2022-03-25 23:26:45.458 Dean:    just been to a party
2022-03-25 19:06:01.600 Dean:    Just going out for a while, back later!
2022-03-25 16:11:19.594 Dean:    jealous of their skill
2022-03-25 16:06:29.888 Dean:    I have yet so much to learn
2022-03-25 15:58:09.399 Dean:    I like to visit a good workshop
2022-03-25 15:48:07.655 Dean:     A good powerful 240v motor is a thing to own...
2022-03-25 15:47:25.960 Dean:    my lathe is powered by an old washing machine motor of probably 50s vintage
2022-03-25 15:47:04.535 Dean:    When I do dispose of a wash. m/c then I often keep the motors as I just can't throw them away
2022-03-25 15:46:36.206 Dean:    agreed
2022-03-25 14:30:51.664 Dean:    two solenoid-operated input valves normally cost £12 a pair but it you seal them in a plastci box and encase the water hose in a corrugated outer hose you can charge £200 for the same thing
2022-03-25 14:29:28.319 Dean:    the Siemens/Miele are over- complex and the parts are exorbitant and sometimes encased in boxes so they can charge more
2022-03-25 14:28:40.471 Dean:    especaillyt the cheaper varieties of white good
2022-03-25 14:28:27.588 Dean:    and these days a lot of the bits are modular
2022-03-25 14:28:05.759 Dean:    so I have no fear of motors and electrics (except for capacitors and stupidity on my part)
2022-03-25 14:27:36.439 Dean:    then Hornby trains
2022-03-25 14:27:29.836 Dean:    I started by fixing Scalectrix cars, motors, brushes, pick ups &c
2022-03-25 12:21:10.656 Dean:    what would you have done?
2022-03-25 12:21:02.200 Dean:    but it needed to be done
2022-03-25 12:20:53.736 Dean:    overkill I suppose
2022-03-25 12:20:48.920 Dean:    
2022-03-25 12:20:48.712 Dean:    
2022-03-25 12:20:46.878 Dean:    looks like new
2022-03-25 12:20:39.049 Dean:    and I de-rusted every bit of surface rust I could find in the process
2022-03-25 12:20:17.632 Dean:    certainly more than the machine is worth
2022-03-25 12:19:56.224 Dean:    If the repairman had been called it would have costdouble for the parts (at least) then £35 per hour plus call out
2022-03-25 12:18:48.008 Dean:    so,onto the next machine and victory!
2022-03-25 12:18:33.569 Dean:    as the amount od washing is so great
2022-03-25 12:18:25.112 Dean:    I have to have two machines I realise
2022-03-25 12:18:11.776 Dean:    now the MAIN!
2022-03-25 12:18:06.784 Dean:    all finished
2022-03-25 12:18:02.288 Dean:    That was the replacement (spare)
2022-03-25 12:17:55.160 Dean:    
2022-03-25 12:17:48.712 Dean:    and machine is working like a trooper again
2022-03-25 12:17:40.269 Dean:    all very cheap
2022-03-25 12:17:30.280 Dean:    and so a new switch was ordered £7
2022-03-25 12:17:19.168 Dean:    abd then I found that my Hotpoint had a recall on the door switch
2022-03-25 12:16:56.372 Dean:    I could have dismantled and cleaned and replaced (in fact I did that afterwards) but at £20 a rreplacement was too cheap to avoid doing
2022-03-25 12:16:23.680 Dean:    I also installed a new main PCB £20 as the old rotary switches were failing to make contact
2022-03-25 12:15:58.024 Dean:    just to keep the machine washing!
2022-03-25 12:15:44.188 Dean:    I fitted the new brushes that arrived by post, the previous were those that I knocked up myself from parts of various wash m/cs
2022-03-25 12:15:10.328 Dean:    I seem to be doing nothing but fix washing machines!

2022-03-24 12:49:22.646 Dean:    I did an amplifier board single channel

2022-03-19 10:26:54.861 Dean:    just tweaking it
2022-03-19 10:26:49.517 Dean:    the archive file is written and the current file automatically stripped of old data beyond a certain number of days

2022-03-17 16:27:43.667 Dean:    removing Do Events fixed it
2022-03-17 16:27:34.801 Dean:    and int he combined window it failed altogether
2022-03-17 16:27:21.601 Dean:    but when it overlapped the bottom window it did not
2022-03-17 16:27:11.210 Dean:    when the upper menu was overlapping the bottom split window it worked
2022-03-17 16:26:39.602 Dean:    a strange bug with DoEvents that is meant to clear the current outstanding event list but it is affected by the mouse position and which control has focus
2022-03-17 16:25:52.153 Dean:    fixed copy and quote menu option in the combined text window
2022-03-17 16:25:30.449 Dean:    FCW - some small coding
2022-03-17 12:35:38.204 Dean:    if you have taken Latin as a subject it is SO true

2022-03-17 11:21:08.208 Dean:    
2022-03-17 11:21:06.600 Dean:    for example
2022-03-17 11:21:03.001 Dean:    so, I could have an evening with Lucy
2022-03-17 11:20:52.288 Dean:    so that you can hire someone to care for your dependant and then go out
2022-03-17 11:20:20.433 Dean:    I have been told there is a respite group that can provide up to £500 for respite care

2022-03-14 22:49:40.571 Dean:    dismounting and possibly dismantling the old battery tomorrow
2022-03-14 22:49:19.440 Dean:    all my 18650s are now tested
2022-03-14 22:49:06.015 Dean:    
2022-03-14 22:48:58.636 Dean:    We now have to open it, drill it, solder a cable to the connectors , remove the reamaining prongs, add strain relief
2022-03-14 22:48:06.204 Dean:    I go for solid metal prongs  where possible, v. old style
2022-03-14 22:47:40.755 Dean:    I told him that I always replace such devices with proper plugs that can be earthed
2022-03-14 22:47:05.795 Dean:    the prong broke
2022-03-14 22:47:00.864 Dean:    my boy paid for an expensive PSU to provide power to USB 3 units (he never takes nor asks for my advice) and he bought a unit whose plug had no earth and just a plastic  top prong
2022-03-14 22:45:37.595 Dean:    if I can't find one here will order one
2022-03-14 18:54:47.373 Dean:    see if I have one in my stock
2022-03-14 18:54:35.906 Dean:    I need to obtain one of the two pin connectors
2022-03-14 18:54:15.603 Dean:    I have plenty going spare
2022-03-14 17:45:28.250 Dean:    does the spec sheet state what is required? 5-12v DC specified on the board
2022-03-14 17:44:54.516 Dean:    to power the things
2022-03-14 17:44:44.931 Dean:    I think we might need a PSU next
2022-03-14 17:44:32.555 Dean:    we have proven that
2022-03-14 17:44:22.931 Dean:    your brain is superior to mine
2022-03-14 17:44:09.803 Dean:    that's absolutely true
2022-03-14 16:07:15.306 Dean:    If I manage to obtain more in quantity then I may invest in a device that can do multipel items simultaneously
2022-03-14 15:42:55.651 Dean:    only two more 18650s to test
