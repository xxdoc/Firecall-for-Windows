2022-01-02 18:55:56.973 Dean:    which I suspect
2022-01-02 18:55:52.718 Dean:    I will try it on Win10 and see if the problems are specific to it

2022-01-02 18:55:33.198 Dean:    I have proven it works
2022-01-02 18:55:25.701 Dean:    I have the app working for email from Win7 using four accounts
2022-01-02 18:55:07.669 Dean:    so,
2022-01-02 18:55:04.277 Dean:    
2022-01-02 18:54:59.206 Dean:    too much security, too much to code
2022-01-02 18:54:47.629 Dean:    in fact I think email will die if it all becomes too complex
2022-01-02 18:54:31.118 Dean:    email clients are dying out
2022-01-02 18:54:12.702 Dean:    email is becoming too complex!
2022-01-02 18:54:01.621 Dean:    Thunderbird and sylpheed
2022-01-02 18:53:53.989 Dean:    
2022-01-02 18:53:49.398 Dean:    tried two clients both failed
2022-01-02 18:53:35.422 Dean:    So that was pointless
2022-01-02 18:53:23.789 Dean:    a total failure
2022-01-02 18:53:20.069 Dean:    I have just spent hours creating a yahoo email account and trying to confugure my client (TB) to work with it
2022-01-02 18:52:54.685 Dean:    
2022-01-02 18:52:50.766 Dean:    Well, I give up for the moment

2022-01-02 16:06:25.725 Dean:    and it works for me
2022-01-02 16:06:21.885 Dean:    it passes the correct password to gmail SMTP server

2022-01-02 13:37:03.580 Dean:    jsut not enough...
2022-01-02 13:36:59.108 Dean:    reliable
2022-01-02 13:36:56.268 Dean:    but more rleiable
2022-01-02 13:36:48.828 Dean:    same as the Win APIs
2022-01-02 13:36:42.036 Dean:    but not others...
2022-01-02 13:36:35.724 Dean:    some password combinations were working
2022-01-02 13:36:22.124 Dean:    not difficult
2022-01-02 13:36:19.028 Dean:    so, my workaround routines need rejigging
2022-01-02 13:36:04.252 Dean:    the FSO method does handle unicode supposedly but there is another bug as the writing does not
2022-01-02 13:35:27.044 Dean:    I have to rewrite my two routines to use the unicode method of writing that I am using for the main data files
2022-01-02 13:34:54.640 Dean:    
2022-01-02 13:08:05.594 Dean:    still a bug to be ironed out
2022-01-02 13:07:59.268 Dean:    don't do it yet

2022-01-02 13:02:57.485 Dean:    I cannot make your gmail SMTP details work
2022-01-02 13:02:44.232 Dean:    
2022-01-02 12:45:58.675 Dean:    but it matters not
2022-01-02 12:45:53.417 Dean:    so slower
2022-01-02 12:45:49.148 Dean:    have to read/write whole file/write updated date to temporary file and then rename/delete old
2022-01-02 12:45:15.061 Dean:    they do not read/write using keys so a little slower
2022-01-02 12:45:00.861 Dean:    so, two new routines created as a workaround
2022-01-02 12:44:42.339 Dean:    but that only occurred when I changed the variable name
2022-01-02 12:44:03.419 Dean:    then it happened to the writing too
2022-01-02 12:43:55.740 Dean:    for a while it was only the reading of the data
2022-01-02 12:43:43.930 Dean:    happened randomly
2022-01-02 12:43:30.995 Dean:    it was the API havig a wobbly when writing my encrypted data
2022-01-02 12:43:10.431 Dean:    
2022-01-02 12:43:01.818 Dean:    I will test with your gmail SMTP details shortly

2022-01-02 11:28:08.296 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-01-02 11:28:00.338 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-01-02 01:12:51.251 Dean:    SO many bugs in Windows and none of them MINE!
2022-01-02 01:12:37.956 Dean:    
2022-01-02 01:01:59.783 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-01-02 00:48:10.831 Dean:    I will send you the new version whan I have tested it
2022-01-02 00:19:06.553 Dean:    and it is
2022-01-02 00:19:04.758 Dean:    just tested it is inow writing correctly 
2022-01-02 00:18:50.825 Dean:    but it will work
2022-01-02 00:18:43.740 Dean:    it is now slower to read and write the settings.ini file
2022-01-02 00:18:30.385 Dean:    just as I did when reading
2022-01-02 00:18:21.662 Dean:    so I have bypassed the API
2022-01-02 00:18:11.410 Dean:    but the API that writes the string to the INI file was placing four strange double chars after the encrypted password
2022-01-02 00:17:22.130 Dean:    but the password itself was encrypted and written identically
2022-01-02 00:17:04.093 Dean:    I changed the key from pop3Password to SMTPPassword
2022-01-02 00:16:11.961 Dean:    and with those passwords
2022-01-02 00:16:00.881 Dean:    it was working
2022-01-02 00:15:56.575 Dean:    yes it is the write API
2022-01-02 00:15:51.301 Dean:    
2022-01-01 23:06:09.516 Dean:    but I will need to determine why, all of a sudden
2022-01-01 23:05:55.363 Dean:    I think the write API is doing the same
2022-01-01 23:05:43.395 Dean:    due to a failure of the read API to recognise some chars
2022-01-01 23:05:26.450 Dean:    the API that reads from an INI file has been replaced by a manual tool that does the same
2022-01-01 23:05:02.966 Dean:    same again
2022-01-01 23:05:00.267 Dean:    I think I have found the bug 
2022-01-01 23:04:50.843 Dean:    
2022-01-01 22:43:00.157 Dean:    I need to find out why
2022-01-01 22:42:50.391 Dean:    I think the password is being decrypted incorrectly at the time it tests
2022-01-01 22:42:28.419 Dean:    I will research
2022-01-01 22:42:23.099 Dean:    stop for the moment
2022-01-01 22:40:25.864 Dean:    but it worked well, we have probably flooded it with incorrect credentials
2022-01-01 22:40:04.253 Dean:    gmail has stopped working here too
2022-01-01 21:54:36.868 Dean:    and I'll try and decrypt it here
2022-01-01 21:54:15.803 Dean:    would you send me your encrypted pass code from the settings.ini that resulted in redaxota's
2022-01-01 21:53:32.192 Dean:    it is strange, that incorrect reading of the password
2022-01-01 21:52:28.134 Dean:    back again
2022-01-01 17:27:45.102 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2022-01-01 17:26:15.162 Dean:    should be just redaxota
2022-01-01 17:25:51.694 Dean:    there were extra characters
2022-01-01 17:25:44.798 Dean:    on your pipex pwd
2022-01-01 17:25:37.791 Dean:    
2022-01-01 17:24:39.196 Dean:    unsure what some of the chars might be
2022-01-01 17:24:24.748 Dean:    can you send it here as text pls
2022-01-01 17:24:16.712 Dean:    your password for gmail
2022-01-01 17:22:23.877 Dean:    pipex was the most tricky
2022-01-01 16:04:09.195 Dean:    y
2022-01-01 16:04:07.026 Dean:    and ou have to say yes to network access if it does...
2022-01-01 16:03:52.482 Dean:    The firewall message will pop up
2022-01-01 16:02:53.600 Dean:    as those a re live accounts
2022-01-01 16:02:47.547 Dean:    please destroy them afterwards!
2022-01-01 16:02:25.592 Dean:    so you can try those if you want
2022-01-01 16:02:19.037 Dean:    
2022-01-01 16:02:05.867 Dean:    including passwords

2021-12-31 20:06:51.221 Dean:    the question is - is it worth it?
2021-12-31 20:06:42.117 Dean:    I think ti would be trivial to implement
2021-12-31 20:06:33.565 Dean:    
2021-12-31 20:06:16.661 Dean:    if that's the right word
2021-12-31 20:06:08.478 Dean:    but obscuration
2021-12-31 20:05:53.885 Dean:    not good encryption
2021-12-31 20:05:48.685 Dean:    then we would have the option of low-cpu low level encryption that would serve to obscure the traffic and provide end to end encryption
2021-12-31 20:04:54.278 Dean:    I think it would be fairly simple
2021-12-31 20:04:46.261 Dean:    do you think you could implement that hashing code I gave you earlier in .js

2021-12-31 16:03:18.980 Dean:    which means I can store the passwords in the settings.ini with some encryption
2021-12-31 16:02:44.820 Dean:    
2021-12-31 16:02:42.940 Dean:    and it extracts the encrypted data successfully
2021-12-31 16:02:25.493 Dean:    a little slower but it does not matter as the file is so small
2021-12-31 16:02:11.989 Dean:    rather than going in and extracting the correct fielf using the keys it loops through the file until it finds the key, reads athe value and exits
2021-12-31 16:01:30.220 Dean:    I have written a short routine that extracts the same values manually from the INI file
2021-12-31 16:01:04.957 Dean:    
2021-12-31 15:44:59.293 Dean:    lookin g into that
2021-12-31 15:44:53.034 Dean:    I may need to conver the resulting string to base64
2021-12-31 15:44:37.788 Dean:    that extra character has been generated by the encryption
2021-12-31 15:44:23.004 Dean:    yes
2021-12-31 15:11:10.308 Dean:    but I will simply have to read the file manually to extract the password
2021-12-31 15:10:49.316 Dean:    nothing I can do
2021-12-31 15:10:36.157 Dean:    with that first char.
2021-12-31 15:10:17.492 Dean:    the reading API cannot cope
2021-12-31 15:10:08.764 Dean:    I look in the file and it there correctly so the API writes it successfully

2021-12-31 15:09:37.639 Dean:    when I read it back it becomes this

2021-12-31 15:09:08.797 Dean:    is encrypted to this
2021-12-31 15:08:51.229 Dean:    for example this password ^$D2!Y93J_1Y!l)
2021-12-31 15:08:16.909 Dean:    so ignores it, giving me an icorrect string to decode
2021-12-31 15:08:01.805 Dean:    it does not recognise the char
2021-12-31 15:07:53.996 Dean:    only ones with certain chars that have been generated by the encryption
2021-12-31 15:07:28.308 Dean:    it does not do this on any string
2021-12-31 15:07:18.669 Dean:    it reads the string successfully but minus the first char.
2021-12-31 15:07:02.396 Dean:    and when it reads the string using the equivalent API function GetPrivateProfileStringW
2021-12-31 15:06:35.189 Dean:    but when I write the string to an .ini file using the in-built API function WritePrivateProfileStringW it writes correctly

2021-12-31 15:05:35.724 Dean:    as always a stumbling block
2021-12-31 15:05:25.782 Dean:    
2021-12-31 13:59:46.916 Dean:    not a pretty UI
2021-12-31 13:59:39.404 Dean:    and then within the dashboard itself
2021-12-31 13:59:27.204 Dean:    I had to search on the web
2021-12-31 13:59:17.244 Dean:    but it was in the gmail dashboard
2021-12-31 13:59:05.899 Dean:    unsure
2021-12-31 13:50:15.212 Dean:    testing shortly using hotmail, outlook and ppipex/talk talk
2021-12-31 13:49:51.747 Dean:    but it is an acceptable level of security
2021-12-31 13:49:36.579 Dean:    it may well still need the 'extra' authentication Oauth that gmail does by default, to be disabled on the gmail dashboard
2021-12-31 13:49:01.027 Dean:    My program is now successfully sending messages using STARTTLS to gmail accounts
2021-12-31 13:14:20.251 Dean:    we have discussions like that all the time in my family
2021-12-31 12:20:13.188 Dean:    and very cheap
2021-12-31 12:20:00.804 Dean:    and is certainly good enough for home use
2021-12-31 12:19:50.668 Dean:    but it will do
2021-12-31 12:19:47.123 Dean:    and it is not the toughest of rugged construction
2021-12-31 12:19:30.859 Dean:    it comes in a box and has to be assembled
2021-12-31 12:19:16.755 Dean:    but in red
2021-12-31 12:19:12.339 Dean:    https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/19038107624?iid=362279467690
2021-12-31 12:19:10.747 Dean:    the toolbox is this one
2021-12-31 12:18:26.404 Dean:    
2021-12-31 12:18:26.260 Dean:    
2021-12-31 12:18:14.684 Dean:    but that would mean modifiying the library I am using and I'd rather not get involved in that
2021-12-31 12:17:53.364 Dean:    I suppose I could do the same with all connections and inetercept every type
2021-12-31 12:17:23.155 Dean:    it can be done by the intercepting proxy
2021-12-31 12:17:07.027 Dean:    and finding out if it is possible to log the connection to a window as the connection is made
2021-12-31 12:16:35.820 Dean:    I am just updating and improving the EMail documentation of FCW
2021-12-31 12:16:19.515 Dean:

2021-12-31 12:04:53.196 Dean:    I had a bottle of port, sherbert lemons and licorice - they know me well
2021-12-31 12:04:35.419 Dean:    the gin and wine sound good
2021-12-31 12:04:28.196 Dean:    
2021-12-31 12:04:19.168 Dean:    that will replace multiple cantilever toolboxes
2021-12-31 12:03:59.748 Dean:    a proper one on casters with drawers that open
2021-12-31 12:03:46.051 Dean:    I received some trousers (mole skin) and I bought myself a tool box
2021-12-31 12:03:08.933 Dean:    is that a bit of kit you have always wanted or something you intend to use soon?
2021-12-31 12:02:48.990 Dean:    looks expensive
2021-12-31 11:56:32.413 Dean:    did you buy anything for yourself?
2021-12-31 11:56:21.420 Dean:    I forgot to ask, did you receive any good Xmas presents?
2021-12-31 11:56:07.982 Dean:    
2021-12-31 11:56:05.596 Dean:    yes, well enough
2021-12-31 10:45:37.651 Dean:    all well?

2021-12-30 22:24:52.562 Dean:    more testing to be done
2021-12-30 22:24:41.546 Dean:    
2021-12-30 22:24:37.074 Dean:    and it worked off the shelf first time
2021-12-30 22:24:25.768 Dean:    and he just did it
2021-12-30 22:24:20.890 Dean:    and this chap WQWETO just said it was something he'd been wanting to add for a while
2021-12-30 22:23:54.941 Dean:    as to the best route for STARTTLS
2021-12-30 22:23:44.017 Dean:    I asked on the vbforum, or rather inquired
2021-12-30 22:23:17.283 Dean:    at the right point
2021-12-30 22:23:12.011 Dean:    and then intercepting the link to the port and injecting the STARTTLS command
2021-12-30 22:22:42.250 Dean:    it involves adding a library containing the encryption methods used for TLS
2021-12-30 22:22:05.090 Dean:    except for this method
2021-12-30 22:21:57.866 Dean:    there seem to be very few FOSS alternatives
2021-12-30 22:21:30.447 Dean:    but the cost is in the hundreds
2021-12-30 22:21:17.514 Dean:    it can be achieved with 3rd party libraries
2021-12-30 22:21:01.466 Dean:    my program is currently the only one in the world using this MITM method
2021-12-30 22:20:21.386 Dean:    the program has managed to send a STARTTLS email to gmail successfully
2021-12-30 21:29:30.137 Dean:    I have updated the firecall help file and I'll bundle that up too shortly and send you the revised version
2021-12-30 21:28:59.850 Dean:    
2021-12-30 21:28:46.428 Dean:    might have a glass of port later
2021-12-30 21:28:30.354 Dean:    nothing too Christmassy today
2021-12-30 21:28:13.386 Dean:    watching a documentary on the discovery of a skeleton under Stirling Castle
2021-12-30 21:27:46.729 Dean:    
2021-12-30 21:27:35.498 Dean:    so far, so good
2021-12-30 21:27:30.794 Dean:    successfully doing so
2021-12-30 19:28:28.815 Dean:    I now need to figure out how to integrate it into my program
2021-12-30 19:28:03.085 Dean:    using an MITM proxy
2021-12-30 19:26:08.474 Dean:    via gmail
2021-12-30 19:25:31.345 Dean:    I have managed to send TLS email
2021-12-30 11:29:36.284 Dean:    the STARTTLS command is a negotiation between the sender and the server and it waist for the command and the MITM gives it at the right time
2021-12-30 11:28:50.686 Dean:    but it is an approach
2021-12-30 11:28:41.558 Dean:    but it does not yet work so I am investigating
2021-12-30 11:28:28.030 Dean:    it does that
2021-12-30 11:28:25.219 Dean:    and it receives the stream and then it should talk to the server and return a response
2021-12-30 11:27:48.952 Dean:    so far I have it running as a separate program and I see it holding open the port I need to talk to it
2021-12-30 11:27:22.895 Dean:    MITM Man in the middle
2021-12-30 11:27:12.128 Dean:    it involves a MITM program that holds open a port and when FCW needs to do STARTTLS we talk to it, it connects to the port and it injects the STARTTLS command into the stream at the correct point
2021-12-30 11:25:21.239 Dean:    I have a potential solution to the starttls issue on port 587 preventing comms o email servers
2021-12-30 11:24:51.732 Dean:    Morning!
2021-12-30 11:24:50.513 Dean:    Hello!
2021-12-30 01:19:29.253 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2021-12-29 16:14:46.398 Dean:    testing next with outlook
2021-12-29 16:14:33.275 Dean:    and with the less secure apps setting switched ON in google panel
2021-12-29 16:14:13.159 Dean:    with those settings
2021-12-29 16:14:00.117 Dean:    <><>gmail.png
2021-12-29 16:12:45.078 Dean:    I can successfully send using FCW attached to a gmail account
2021-12-29 16:11:29.306 Dean:    I have a tool that allows me to edit the saved accounbt details and passwords
2021-12-29 16:11:15.405 Dean:    same here
2021-12-29 16:06:31.415 Dean:    it is becoming more and more difficult to do anything by computer
2021-12-29 16:06:17.388 Dean:    honestly, when setting up email becomes so complicated I wonder what have we come to?
2021-12-29 16:05:52.864 Dean:    
2021-12-29 16:05:50.321 Dean:    and the next step is to try to to do the same with FCW
2021-12-29 16:05:35.373 Dean:    
2021-12-29 16:05:31.940 Dean:    I can now connect via thunderbird to gmail
2021-12-29 16:05:16.429 Dean:    but I did it
2021-12-29 16:05:10.782 Dean:    as interfaces these days are sh1t
2021-12-29 16:04:57.518 Dean:    not easy to find
2021-12-29 16:04:52.197 Dean:    and found an option to enable access to less secure apps
2021-12-29 16:04:39.514 Dean:    and went to my google control panel
2021-12-29 16:04:24.160 Dean:    
2021-12-29 16:04:22.896 Dean:    a
2021-12-29 16:04:21.523 Dean:    finally, manged to do it manually
2021-12-29 16:04:14.030 Dean:    and it caused multiple pop ups, each time I tried to create the account on TB, none of which would work
2021-12-29 16:03:42.430 Dean:    it uses a Oauth authorisation method that is incompatible with my email client thunderbird
2021-12-29 16:03:11.941 Dean:    took me ages
2021-12-29 16:02:45.165 Dean:    I have just created a gmail account (what a to-do)
2021-12-29 11:07:02.825 Dean:    as an interim
2021-12-29 11:06:15.072 Dean:    or powershell
2021-12-29 11:06:10.001 Dean:    I may have to use a VB.NET program to handle the TLS email
2021-12-29 11:04:15.529 Dean:    and I can fix them
2021-12-29 11:03:42.536 Dean:    when I test on Win10 these problems should become apparent
2021-12-29 11:02:36.784 Dean:    so that the prefs tab icons do not have a grey border around them on later versions of Windows
2021-12-29 11:01:56.440 Dean:    the themeing should work better on the prefs on the next version
2021-12-29 10:22:44.460 Dean:    if you could look into that it would be useful
2021-12-29 10:22:29.300 Dean:    gmail has an option on your gmail account that requires you to lower the security accepting connections from less secure sources
2021-12-29 10:21:49.971 Dean:    requires TLS
2021-12-29 10:21:44.812 Dean:    pipex (talk talk) will not
2021-12-29 10:21:33.836 Dean:    next to try is outlook
2021-12-29 10:21:25.940 Dean:    I have tried the hotmail and that works
2021-12-29 10:21:15.988 Dean:    do you have a hotmail or outlook account?
2021-12-29 10:21:05.324 Dean:    I will try gmail account
2021-12-29 10:20:49.175 Dean:

2021-12-29 10:20:18.081 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2021-12-29 00:15:23.824 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.

2021-12-29 00:15:16.656 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2021-12-29 00:15:15.578 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire

2021-12-29 00:15:10.792 Dean:    goodnight
2021-12-29 00:14:49.353 Dean:    there is a chance it will work
2021-12-29 00:14:40.242 Dean:    change it to 25 and see what occurs
2021-12-29 00:14:33.081 Dean:    which requires port 587
2021-12-29 00:14:19.842 Dean:    port 587 will never work as CDO does not support starttls
2021-12-29 00:13:58.905 Dean:    and the CDO commands worked
2021-12-29 00:13:51.737 Dean:    but it worked
2021-12-29 00:13:45.410 Dean:    as I suspected that i might baulk on that cdosys.dll
2021-12-29 00:13:20.594 Dean:    the good thing is that the program runs!
2021-12-29 00:12:58.943 Dean:    and see if that works
2021-12-29 00:11:43.459 Dean:    try tomorrow with port 25
2021-12-28 23:44:39.056 Dean:    for email via SMTP SSL
2021-12-28 23:44:13.500 Dean:    it has a library that is usable by javascript too
2021-12-28 23:43:31.866 Dean:    http://ostrosoft.com/ossmtp.aspx
2021-12-28 23:43:29.010 Dean:    this is interesting

2021-12-28 19:24:45.865 Dean:    I csn cause port 24. authentication as  base 64 encoded and security using SSL/TLS to send me a test mail using hotmail's SMTP server
2021-12-28 19:17:01.904 Dean:    no other email functionality currently is implemented
2021-12-28 19:16:44.120 Dean:    all the email tab does is to allow the sending of an email as a test
2021-12-28 19:16:14.105 Dean:    On Win7
2021-12-28 19:13:16.312 Dean:    I did not have to register it as it walready registered
2021-12-28 19:13:00.072 Dean:    ie. it needs to be registered
2021-12-28 19:07:33.993 Dean:    it requires the CDOsys lib to be present and for Win10 to recognise it
2021-12-28 19:07:06.304 Dean:    0.1779
2021-12-28 19:06:49.972 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2021-12-28 19:06:10.633 Dean:    there is a good chance the new ver. of  FCW will work
2021-12-28 19:05:58.304 Dean:    ah, good
2021-12-28 17:47:00.048 Dean:    just checking it is in place on Win 10/11
2021-12-28 17:46:48.577 Dean:    That is the library with the email functions
2021-12-28 17:41:41.520 Dean:    use 'everything' to find it
2021-12-28 17:41:29.824 Dean:

2021-12-28 17:41:23.089 Dean:    Can you see if you have the following file on your PC?
2021-12-28 17:41:08.080 Dean:    
2021-12-28 17:35:09.863 Dean:    <><>FCWPrefsEmail.png
2021-12-28 17:19:59.417 Dean:    I have used some simple encryption in the past within VB6 so I'll dig out that code
2021-12-28 17:19:24.961 Dean:    I also need to add some encryption to allow the password to be stored securely
2021-12-28 17:18:41.257 Dean:    
2021-12-28 17:17:34.048 Dean:    so, now I have emails working, I can decide what to do with the things
2021-12-28 17:17:14.257 Dean:    
2021-12-28 16:01:22.304 Dean:    I could possibly implement the powershell method for TLS 1.2
2021-12-28 16:00:56.224 Dean:    then I can narrow down the reasons whey it won't work and then test with different SMTP types
2021-12-28 16:00:25.209 Dean:    now I know my code is correctly functioning given the correct settings
2021-12-28 15:59:59.457 Dean:    at least once!
2021-12-28 15:59:46.086 Dean:    trouble is, it is difficult to diagnose your code until you have actually made a working connection
2021-12-28 15:59:18.274 Dean:    it fails
2021-12-28 15:59:13.809 Dean:    and even when I haqve configured CDO to handle starttls
2021-12-28 15:58:47.864 Dean:    it seems CDO with port 587 is dedicated to TLS1.2
2021-12-28 15:58:22.139 Dean:    
2021-12-28 15:58:13.333 Dean:    using hotmail SMTP
2021-12-28 15:57:52.627 Dean:    port 25 base encoded authentication and SSL enabled
2021-12-28 15:57:16.515 Dean:    but not with the port 587 and the TLS1.2 encryption
2021-12-28 15:57:01.029 Dean:    using the second CDO method 
2021-12-28 15:52:06.825 Dean:    Wow! I just managed to send my first email using FCW
2021-12-28 12:16:14.407 Dean:    4th day?
2021-12-28 12:16:10.216 Dean:    Merry Christmas by the way
2021-12-28 12:16:02.360 Dean:    
2021-12-28 11:34:40.663 Dean:    which annoys me as it should be possible to do this from within VB6
2021-12-28 11:34:27.072 Dean:    so some last digging and I will revert to your solution
2021-12-28 11:34:05.237 Dean:    
2021-12-28 11:34:02.374 Dean:    I find the C anc C++ crowd trying the same tools and failing...
2021-12-28 11:33:39.831 Dean:    but emailing using any language seems a fraught patht to take
2021-12-28 11:33:21.751 Dean:    part of this is bacause I am using an old tool
2021-12-28 11:32:55.128 Dean:    The more I program with Microsoft tools the more shoddy I find the edifice to be.
2021-12-28 11:32:33.914 Dean:    
2021-12-28 11:32:30.119 Dean:    I will revert to Powershell which is at least proven to work!
2021-12-28 11:32:11.015 Dean:    and then if that fails
2021-12-28 11:32:05.711 Dean:    so I will raise a forum post on emailing from VB6
2021-12-28 11:31:34.479 Dean:    I have spent dasy upon it
2021-12-28 11:31:21.579 Dean:    I have some code and it is unmaintained and does not work for me
2021-12-28 11:31:08.503 Dean:    for creating sockets durectly to the SMTP servers
2021-12-28 11:30:41.519 Dean:    then there is a low level method that requres the use of Winsock API
2021-12-28 11:30:20.807 Dean:    it stops at the previous. and cannot be relied upon - bloody Microsoft.
2021-12-28 11:29:55.631 Dean:    then found out that they have failed to equip it with the latest TLS capability
2021-12-28 11:29:22.478 Dean:    then I tried a Microsoft recommended tool designed specifically for this called CDO
2021-12-28 11:28:57.672 Dean:    Have tried various methods of emailing  from VB6 using a VBSendMail program that worked for the community for a long while prior to new encryption methods

2021-12-26 12:32:57.119 Dean:    in retrospect I should have done them the other way round, letting the beef rest for an hour or two
2021-12-26 12:32:28.679 Dean:    and it was a little dry by the afternoon
2021-12-26 12:32:18.865 Dean:    I did a goose in the morning
2021-12-26 12:31:54.627 Dean:    and I was cooking it (12.5lbs) from mid-day
2021-12-26 12:31:14.183 Dean:    We had the usual beef at dinner (17:00)
2021-12-26 12:30:28.580 Dean:    they survived the test?

2021-12-22 18:23:04.595 Dean:    just need to find a way to utilise Wine in a non Windows linux binary
2021-12-22 18:22:41.864 Dean:    or somehow using WINE to bridge the gap as the vast majority of win APIs are already coded
2021-12-22 18:22:01.798 Dean:    (many/most just don't have a direct map)
2021-12-22 18:21:44.897 Dean:    either throught the use of polyfills (too  many would be required and each complex) , one to one mapping of Win-> Linux APIs
2021-12-22 18:21:05.905 Dean:    I have been dis cussing how to handle the use of Win APIs on other non Windows systems since VB6 may eventually go multiplatform
2021-12-22 14:39:56.550 Dean:    there is some coding stuff going on

2021-12-22 14:39:35.547 Dean:    peas *c
2021-12-22 14:39:28.727 Dean:    to serve with rice later
2021-12-22 14:39:21.126 Dean:    cooking pork belly on the pan
2021-12-22 14:39:13.275 Dean:    
2021-12-22 14:38:49.738 Dean:    I meant on an older chair
2021-12-22 14:38:39.258 Dean:    sorry
2021-12-22 14:38:31.307 Dean:    but on a modern chair I would try to use resin
2021-12-22 14:38:12.826 Dean:    but I am on occasion very lazy and use PVA too
2021-12-22 14:37:52.123 Dean:    much better than PVA
2021-12-22 14:37:43.543 Dean:    In the past I have used the resin that you melt in a pan to glue the joints
2021-12-22 14:37:20.850 Dean:    
2021-12-22 14:37:10.939 Dean:    My bum is on one now
2021-12-22 14:36:54.787 Dean:    the older ones are definitely from Chilterns/High Wycombe or thereabouts
2021-12-22 14:36:19.695 Dean:    to a British style
2021-12-22 14:36:13.211 Dean:    our modern ones were Czech made
2021-12-22 14:36:01.191 Dean:    
2021-12-22 14:35:59.811 Dean:    chairs
2021-12-22 14:35:52.259 Dean:    but the old 19thC charis have stood up to the test of time much better than the newer ones
2021-12-22 14:35:25.975 Dean:    we still have it I think
2021-12-22 14:35:11.633 Dean:    so I added a 2x2" block of wood to the underside to give it stability, drilled through the middle of each glued section, then dowelled to hide screws
2021-12-22 14:33:56.454 Dean:    on one such chair I could not stop it flexing, I imagine someone had left it out in the rain one night
2021-12-22 14:32:36.680 Dean:    if that should happen
2021-12-22 14:32:30.489 Dean:    not so easy to repair as you need to drill long holes for long dowelling
2021-12-22 14:31:55.135 Dean:    Thr problem with those more modern types of cottage chair is that the base comprises glued sections and they can come apart if the drilled holes are right through the glue line
2021-12-22 13:14:10.963 Dean:    heat is rather nice!
2021-12-22 13:14:05.659 Dean:    
2021-12-22 13:14:00.530 Dean:    so an easy one for me with a drill and a wire brush
2021-12-22 13:13:45.363 Dean:    another job I used to do more than once a year
2021-12-22 13:13:32.316 Dean:    it is no mre complex than cleaning spark plugs
2021-12-22 13:13:16.827 Dean:    without maintenance
2021-12-22 13:13:07.363 Dean:    and seem to only last < 1 year
2021-12-22 13:12:56.426 Dean:    the themocouples need care and attention

2021-12-22 13:12:39.900 Dean:    
2021-12-22 13:12:34.018 Dean:    don't want to split the base
2021-12-22 13:12:26.371 Dean:    before I redo the joints
2021-12-22 13:12:12.867 Dean:    that I might resolve with drilling/dowelling
2021-12-22 13:12:03.658 Dean:    slight spilts near where the main verticals are forced in
2021-12-22 13:11:36.091 Dean:    the base, solid wood
2021-12-22 13:11:28.114 Dean:    just old cottage chairs
2021-12-22 13:11:20.555 Dean:    nothing special
2021-12-22 13:11:16.363 Dean:    could be 19th C easily
2021-12-22 13:11:08.002 Dean:    my chairs are old beech items, turn of the last centiury or as late as the 1930s
2021-12-22 13:10:31.731 Dean:    photos required of chair
2021-12-22 13:10:23.804 Dean:

2021-12-22 13:10:14.315 Dean:    so all good
2021-12-22 13:10:08.995 Dean:    been on now for ten hours overnight
2021-12-22 13:09:48.747 Dean:    previously it had been going out...
2021-12-22 13:09:40.027 Dean:    and it worked immediately
2021-12-22 13:09:34.539 Dean:    but in the end I cleaned the old one with a wire brush, all important surfaces
2021-12-22 13:09:06.019 Dean:    I bought two new thermocouples just in case
2021-12-22 13:08:38.763 Dean:    took me an hour or two
2021-12-22 13:08:32.450 Dean:    
2021-12-22 13:08:30.058 Dean:    it fails only when a thermocouple is dirty, the connections are corroded or not properly in contact or he probe is not properly in the flame jet
2021-12-22 13:07:42.635 Dean:    I have just replaced the Rayburn thermocouple, cleaned all the connectors, swept out the burner
2021-12-22 13:07:16.018 Dean:    
2021-12-22 13:07:13.700 Dean:    I have to do the same
2021-12-22 13:07:10.075 Dean:    
2021-12-22 10:36:12.981 Dean:    Hello!

2021-12-21 17:54:19.933 Dean:    but not really quite as good
2021-12-21 17:53:21.901 Dean:    and does a fairly decent job
2021-12-21 17:53:09.552 Dean:    but it is safe to use
2021-12-21 17:53:01.903 Dean:    not quite the right thing
2021-12-21 17:52:48.631 Dean:    as I have it to hand
2021-12-21 17:52:42.874 Dean:    I tend to use olive oil  on the surfaces on a regular basis
2021-12-21 17:52:19.495 Dean:    yes
2021-12-21 10:29:16.285 Dean:    Good Morning!

2021-12-17 13:30:11.172 Dean:    and tuples on functions

2021-12-17 13:29:17.649 Dean:    some want C-style syntax
2021-12-17 13:29:01.809 Dean:    both taking VB6 into the 21st C.
2021-12-17 13:28:39.577 Dean:    that can be brought into being with the advent of RADBasic andTwinBasic
2021-12-17 13:28:13.362 Dean:    there is a discussion on the VB6 forum about the new language features
2021-12-17 13:27:54.017 Dean:    
2021-12-17 13:27:46.297 Dean:    and all the bugs are known
2021-12-17 13:27:35.577 Dean:    it does mean that it is stable...
2021-12-17 13:27:15.009 Dean:    so some of the other recent language features are missing from VB6
2021-12-17 13:26:43.680 Dean:    the problem is 20 yaers of neglect
2021-12-17 13:26:34.945 Dean:    in many ways VB6 is a good language
2021-12-17 13:26:20.307 Dean:     but it does give flexibility
2021-12-17 13:26:01.521 Dean:    to trigger a specific menu
2021-12-17 13:25:51.077 Dean:    there is more code as you need to add code to each mouseDown event
2021-12-17 13:25:14.926 Dean:    the menu sub-level items are shown
2021-12-17 13:24:58.506 Dean:    and you call just that menu

2021-12-10 12:02:58.830 Dean:    Win 8 and 10 much, much more so
2021-12-10 12:02:48.759 Dean:    that enforcement of styles has only grown since
2021-12-10 12:02:27.254 Dean:    so the buttons correspond with the theme of the o.s
2021-12-10 12:02:13.759 Dean:    instead they wanted to use Windows themeing alone
2021-12-10 12:02:02.998 Dean:    MS do not want you to theme your apps
2021-12-10 12:01:50.126 Dean:    and is non-standard
2021-12-10 12:01:44.726 Dean:    it brings instability
2021-12-10 12:01:36.070 Dean:    but that is o/s level code
2021-12-10 12:01:25.519 Dean:    but only by subclassing and intercepting the messages to the button to override them
2021-12-10 12:01:06.383 Dean:    it is possible to change the text colour
2021-12-10 12:00:55.990 Dean:    it is ridiculous
2021-12-10 11:27:36.679 Dean:    took me a while to figure out why my code was working on all controls but would then fall over in a heap
2021-12-10 11:27:11.782 Dean:    what a stupid limitation
2021-12-10 11:27:00.774 Dean:    Just like Henry Fords first cars
2021-12-10 11:26:47.375 Dean:    they HAVE to be black
2021-12-10 11:26:41.326 Dean:    but not buttons
2021-12-10 11:26:35.023 Dean:    it lets you do so on ALL other controls
2021-12-10 11:26:21.518 Dean:    it seems VB6 does not let you set the font colour
2021-12-10 11:26:05.894 Dean:    except buttons
2021-12-10 11:25:59.783 Dean:    and most work as expected
2021-12-10 11:25:54.335 Dean:    so I set up a case select statement for each ctrl type
2021-12-10 11:25:24.612 Dean:    object can't support this property or method
2021-12-10 11:25:24.495 Dean:                            Ctrl.ForeColor = suppliedColour
2021-12-10 11:24:20.334 Dean:    when it comes to the setting of the colour I keep receiving an error
2021-12-10 11:23:58.014 Dean:    all working as planned
2021-12-10 11:23:49.119 Dean:    and for each I change the font type, size, italics, colour &c
2021-12-10 11:23:23.807 Dean:    I list through all ctrls on a form
2021-12-10 11:23:09.791 Dean:    so, I was having a strange error when setting the font characteristics of my preferences form
2021-12-10 11:22:43.495 Dean:    
2021-12-10 09:38:26.946 Dean:    Good Morning!
2021-12-09 23:28:04.031 Dean:    italics yesterday, colours today
2021-12-09 23:27:43.182 Dean:    colours now set and saved
2021-12-09 23:27:36.520 Dean:    VB6 FCW some minor changes around fonts
2021-12-09 20:32:17.131 Dean:    or a part of it
2021-12-09 20:32:10.129 Dean:    That, by the way is the galley
2021-12-09 20:31:44.834 Dean:    I will seal them
2021-12-09 20:31:41.324 Dean:    then will empty, rinse and when I caqn find my sealant
2021-12-09 20:31:27.502 Dean:    
2021-12-09 20:31:23.302 Dean:    and neutralise any
2021-12-09 20:31:10.910 Dean:    overnight to remove any rust
2021-12-09 20:30:54.697 Dean:    I am filling my two petrol cans with citric acid

2021-12-09 17:08:49.947 Dean:    in the end took a plier to it
2021-12-09 17:08:37.316 Dean:    and would not open
2021-12-09 17:08:30.684 Dean:    our fluff filter was jammed by a cufflink

2021-12-09 13:50:36.642 Dean:    fluff plug I mean
2021-12-09 13:50:29.014 Dean:    my washing machine has failed due to a blocked fluff filter and then when clearing the plug broke!

2021-12-04 17:32:33.395 Dean:    you can't have every known filetype in your app
2021-12-04 17:32:17.795 Dean:    so I have set up the code to help just in case of a missing association
2021-12-04 17:31:28.243 Dean:    but it doesn't
2021-12-04 17:31:22.180 Dean:    I don't know why Windows doesn't know
2021-12-04 17:31:07.499 Dean:    
2021-12-04 17:31:04.068 Dean:    bloody brain!
2021-12-04 17:30:54.539 Dean:    there
2021-12-04 17:30:48.780 Dean:    and their is no association by default
2021-12-04 17:30:37.339 Dean:    oops
2021-12-04 17:30:33.068 Dean:    iN WINDOWS THE ASSOCIATION NEEDS TO BE MADE 
2021-12-04 13:57:56.964 Dean:    I wantto enable it to do something useful
2021-12-04 13:57:28.347 Dean:    and so does nothing
2021-12-04 13:57:23.490 Dean:    the o/s does not know them
2021-12-04 13:57:13.419 Dean:    some file types such as .json do nothing when a shellExecute runs
2021-12-04 13:56:47.364 Dean:    level
2021-12-04 13:56:47.363 Dean:    this overcopmes the problem when a double click cannot open the file due to a lack of file assocoaiation at the windows 
2021-12-04 13:56:20.171 Dean:    and another to open the file in explorer
2021-12-04 13:56:09.906 Dean:    one option to open the file as per a double click
2021-12-04 13:55:51.338 Dean:    I have added a right click menu to the image in the corner
2021-12-04 12:32:57.059 Dean:    something we did not implement
2021-12-04 11:31:22.346 Dean:    I now need to get it working down here
2021-12-04 11:31:11.570 Dean:    so I have it functioning
2021-12-04 11:31:05.466 Dean:    and it works on my old PC upstairs
2021-12-04 11:30:53.595 Dean:    it may be an unused functionality
2021-12-04 11:30:45.994 Dean:    Yes, just dicovered that too
2021-12-04 10:24:46.483 Dean:    it is important!

2021-12-03 17:07:35.275 Dean:    I see the bauble widgets
2021-12-03 17:06:50.075 Dean:    the previous icon I sent is to be inserted into the document icons folder with all the other icons
2021-12-03 17:06:17.994 Dean:    
2021-12-03 17:06:17.459 Dean:    did
2021-12-03 17:06:15.754 Dean:    prior to this it just sat there and di nothing
2021-12-03 17:05:58.130 Dean:    it does not currently recognise .json type
2021-12-03 17:05:45.754 Dean:    if ithere is no file association in the o/s with the attached file type then it generates an err message
2021-12-03 17:05:04.411 Dean:    small fixes

2021-12-03 13:35:07.733 Dean:    I am still tidying
2021-12-03 13:35:03.417 Dean:    Would you be so kind an d look at that code and see if you can add a fix?
2021-12-03 13:32:30.827 Dean:    Are you doing well?
2021-12-03 13:24:48.113 Dean:    I think it is to do to a missing door states json file
2021-12-03 13:18:51.626 Dean:    the only difference is that there might be no initial JSON file to store the positions and sizes
2021-12-03 13:18:30.402 Dean:    no changes this end for two or more years
2021-12-03 13:18:16.970 Dean:    they are just invisible or not there
2021-12-03 13:18:08.931 Dean:    I have turned on debugging but there is no apparrent issue at all
2021-12-03 13:17:53.649 Dean:    the icon is in the dock
2021-12-03 13:17:46.130 Dean:    or have gone transparent or non-visible
2021-12-03 13:17:33.377 Dean:    as if they have gone off screen due to lack of initial positioning data
2021-12-03 13:17:11.386 Dean:    sign
2021-12-03 13:17:08.482 Dean:    no sing of them on the desktop

2021-12-03 13:16:11.202 Dean:    then it waists whilst it creates the baubles

2021-12-01 23:07:03.174 Dean:    
2021-12-01 23:06:59.894 Dean:    you have bigger worries
2021-12-01 23:06:54.034 Dean:    don't worry about files
2021-12-01 23:06:48.634 Dean:    
2021-12-01 23:06:47.454 Dean:    an interesting bug
2021-12-01 23:06:28.878 Dean:    eventually the timestamps would merge as the cpu can run the vb6 code faster and faster
2021-12-01 23:05:56.166 Dean:    that sort of problem is inevitable giventhe fast speed of modern processors
2021-12-01 23:05:28.094 Dean:    it is now quicksorting that as I wish it to
2021-12-01 23:05:10.153 Dean:    -windows-10
2021-12-01 23:05:10.143 Dean:    https://forum.powerbasic.com/forum/user-to-user-discussions/powerbasic-for-windows/792800-audio-recording-and-editing-on
2021-12-01 23:04:40.604 Dean:    ignore next URL
2021-12-01 23:04:36.092 Dean:    
2021-12-01 23:04:32.581 Dean:    I'm off to bed shortly
2021-12-01 23:04:25.501 Dean:    right
2021-12-01 23:04:17.550 Dean:    and played the fire call tune
2021-12-01 23:04:09.950 Dean:    but FCW correctly reported it
2021-12-01 23:03:38.842 Dean:    Dropbox is playing silly buGGers
2021-12-01 23:03:09.857 Dean:    I should guess a one in a ten thousandth occurrence
2021-12-01 23:02:46.434 Dean:    but we'll see
2021-12-01 23:02:34.654 Dean:    it should now pop up a message at least on my end
2021-12-01 23:02:13.050 Dean:    and then I'll be able to see what it looks like
2021-12-01 23:02:00.818 Dean:    if it happens again, please make a copy of my file
2021-12-01 23:01:22.244 Dean:    had to restart it
2021-12-01 23:01:12.884 Dean:    Well, Dropbox just died
2021-12-01 22:58:54.417 Dean:    probably the easiest fix
2021-12-01 22:57:59.887 Dean:            If timeStamp = "" Then MsgBox "%Err-I-ErrorNumber 23 - No valid timestamp generated." ' this occurred just once.
2021-12-01 22:57:59.787 Dean:            
2021-12-01 22:57:59.677 Dean:            Loop While timeStamp = lastTimeStamp
2021-12-01 22:57:59.567 Dean:                timeStamp = fGetDateInUniversalFormat ' add the timestamp format 2018-01-01 00:00:00.000 to the array
2021-12-01 22:57:59.457 Dean:            Do
2021-12-01 22:57:59.347 Dean:    re-ordering two lines with the same timestamp
2021-12-01 22:57:59.337 Dean:            ' a comparison is made here and the timestamp incremented a little to prevent the later non-stable quicksort 
2021-12-01 22:57:59.247 Dean:    
2021-12-01 22:57:59.097 Dean:            lastTimeStamp = timeStamp
2021-12-01 22:57:58.527 Dean:            ' get the last timestamp and remember it!
2021-12-01 22:57:56.927 Dean:    
2021-12-01 22:57:54.737 Dean:    and ensures they are both different
2021-12-01 22:57:42.414 Dean:    with a doo loop that checkes the value of the timestamps
2021-12-01 22:57:22.590 Dean:    I hacked the code that generates a timestamp and writes the line
2021-12-01 22:57:00.227 Dean:    or modifying it to only observe he timestamp as a key
2021-12-01 22:56:42.773 Dean:    instead of replacing the quicksort
2021-12-01 22:56:29.122 Dean:    to handle the timestamp being re-order by the unstabl quick sort
2021-12-01 22:56:10.929 Dean:    
2021-12-01 22:31:29.371 Dean:    hope all is well with Elsa
2021-12-01 22:31:21.940 Dean:    
2021-12-01 22:31:05.896 Dean:    gloves again
2021-12-01 22:31:01.215 Dean:    scuse typos
2021-12-01 22:30:56.795 Dean:    and it affecst us
2021-12-01 22:30:49.374 Dean:    unless it happens again and again
2021-12-01 22:30:41.291 Dean:    I think I won't bother
