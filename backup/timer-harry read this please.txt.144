2022-08-21 12:58:35.889 Dean:    but still interesting to see
2022-08-21 12:58:28.058 Dean:    or the whole lot have expired
2022-08-21 12:58:11.200 Dean:    the others might be fine-ish
2022-08-21 12:58:01.049 Dean:    typically one battery may have died
2022-08-21 12:57:46.479 Dean:    
2022-08-21 12:57:44.979 Dean:    just don't puncture nor short circuit
2022-08-21 12:57:30.282 Dean:    needs a bit of force
2022-08-21 12:57:19.039 Dean:    carefully
2022-08-21 12:57:15.238 Dean:    Worth dismantling

2022-08-18 11:22:39.554 Dean:    forgetting the previous floods where I had reestablished the ditch and covered it with gravel

2022-08-18 11:21:29.704 Dean:    more of a ditch to let the water out
2022-08-18 11:21:12.984 Dean:    and the old drain that used to be in front of the old cottage part of our house has been filled in stupidly
2022-08-18 11:20:43.443 Dean:    we are on a slope

2022-08-17 20:30:36.817 Dean:    actually it is more about the size as I really only need an on/off in the same format

2022-08-17 13:46:28.419 Dean:    it is a small rotary carbon with an on/off switch too
2022-08-17 13:46:01.501 Dean:    I have such a switch but I have lost the collar
2022-08-17 13:45:35.498 Dean:    needs a rotary switch to attach to the knob at the top that is currently floating

2022-08-16 20:30:18.030 Dean:    I have some screws to undo to gain access to see the internals
2022-08-16 20:29:55.358 Dean:    a quick measurement externally shows the battery box is quite a lot larger, an inch of extra in all dimensions
2022-08-16 20:29:15.598 Dean:    if I can find those batteries then I am sure I can find the correct size with similar properties
2022-08-16 20:28:12.161 Dean:    so any improvement will be a benefit
2022-08-16 20:27:56.790 Dean:    the current batteries are standard lead acid and the total amperage will be much less
2022-08-16 20:27:13.078 Dean:    but the concept is sound
2022-08-16 20:27:05.791 Dean:    I'm not sure if they would fit in as I have not yet checked the physical size

2022-08-16 16:07:34.816 Dean:    the price is really falling over the period I have been watching them

2022-08-16 16:06:15.144 Dean:    it is time to change those to 3 x lipo 12v batteries with more charge cycles
2022-08-16 16:05:48.729 Dean:    and inside are 3 x 12v lead acid batteries in series
2022-08-16 16:05:29.702 Dean:    it has a 1.5ft long battery pack
2022-08-16 16:05:13.676 Dean:    and it has a 36v battery pwoering a front hub motor

2022-08-16 08:44:46.583 Dean:    Hello!
2022-08-15 21:08:00.976 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-08-15 21:07:37.663 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-08-15 21:07:36.127 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-08-15 20:42:00.550 Dean:    not yet needed it really but having it removes the range anxiety
2022-08-15 20:41:30.781 Dean:    at the moment I have a 15amp in the frame and another 13amp in the pannier ready for a quick swap
2022-08-15 20:40:55.029 Dean:    I will wait until the technology improves and the currently high capacity batteries come down in price
2022-08-15 20:40:18.801 Dean:    If my bike was 30amp it would be a dream
2022-08-15 20:40:01.509 Dean:    50 in a pack and it soon starts to add up, then the build costs on top and top of the range BMS
2022-08-15 20:39:30.256 Dean:    might be close to 500 for a compact version as each battery is 6-7 GBP
2022-08-15 20:38:50.362 Dean:    30 amp custom build is 400 gbp
2022-08-15 20:38:27.441 Dean:    a 30amp battery is do-able but would be large and bulky or compact and very expensive
2022-08-15 20:37:42.957 Dean:    you could do the same speed without any legs but you'd be lucky to get 1/3rd of the way before the battery died
2022-08-15 20:36:53.019 Dean:    each with legs
2022-08-15 20:36:47.087 Dean:    level 3 is 15-18mph consistently
2022-08-15 20:36:29.268 Dean:    2 is a mere 12mph-14mph
2022-08-15 20:36:11.370 Dean:    top level takes you to 25mph with your legs too
2022-08-15 20:35:48.419 Dean:    There are five levels
2022-08-15 20:35:40.176 Dean:    and it took me there and back at level 2 there and level 3 back
2022-08-15 20:35:21.554 Dean:    the battery is a 15amp battery
2022-08-15 20:35:11.480 Dean:    [quote] So 40 miles on a single battery? [/quote] 
2022-08-15 20:34:37.873 Dean:    do you have a cobbler near you?
2022-08-15 20:34:28.888 Dean:    mending shoes these days is expensive!
2022-08-15 20:34:19.301 Dean:    took my shoes to the menders
2022-08-15 20:34:02.920 Dean:    sanded down another shelf on my pigeon holes for my study, two more to go
2022-08-15 20:33:36.591 Dean:    swept the garage work area of shavings and detritis
2022-08-15 20:33:20.273 Dean:    worked on my bike lamp conversions and repaints
2022-08-15 20:33:02.156 Dean:    did well today
2022-08-15 20:32:58.688 Dean:    
2022-08-15 20:32:46.456 Dean:    lovely
2022-08-15 14:32:09.664 Dean:    If you are careful
2022-08-15 14:30:50.915 Dean:    but I cycle the back roads so another 5-7 on top of that
2022-08-15 14:30:27.405 Dean:    15 miles as the crow flies
2022-08-15 14:30:20.707 Dean:    [quote] How far to the coast and back? [/quote] 
2022-08-15 13:23:30.019 Dean:    without battery it is like pedalling a small landrover
2022-08-15 13:22:56.691 Dean:    battery died just as I reached home
2022-08-15 13:22:26.110 Dean:    cycled to coast
2022-08-15 08:32:37.344 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.

2022-08-14 22:06:24.072 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-08-14 20:39:45.646 Dean:    too big to turn on the lathe
2022-08-14 18:09:00.312 Dean:    now needs to dry and repaint
2022-08-14 18:08:51.985 Dean:    just puttied the interior

2022-08-13 14:55:56.335 Dean:    looks as if I am charging!
2022-08-13 14:55:47.094 Dean:    found an engine by the road!

2022-08-13 14:53:46.341 Dean:    now drinking a pint of iced water
2022-08-13 14:53:30.617 Dean:    I went outside to paint something and quickly swooned 
2022-08-13 14:53:14.348 Dean:    it is too hot outside
2022-08-13 14:49:16.031 Dean:    with only one battery swap out
2022-08-13 14:49:07.692 Dean:    cycled to the coast and back carrying the spare battery in the panniers, meaning that I can cycle 45-60 miles in one trip
2022-08-13 14:48:23.519 Dean:    it has been tested on the ebike
2022-08-13 14:48:04.180 Dean:    changed the box, the connectors, added inline fuses x 2, properly potted and now tested
2022-08-13 14:47:29.767 Dean:    a conversion from one battery type to another
2022-08-13 14:47:15.001 Dean:    a 15amp device
2022-08-13 14:47:02.102 Dean:    I finished one of my bike batteries
2022-08-13 14:46:45.579 Dean:    
2022-08-13 14:46:40.885 Dean:    I quite forgot to test that cap.
2022-08-13 14:46:29.756 Dean:    
2022-08-13 14:45:46.418 Dean:    without any potential for drain
2022-08-13 14:45:37.897 Dean:    so I can keep the 9v battery attached
2022-08-13 14:45:23.884 Dean:    I just added a small on/off switch
2022-08-13 14:45:08.773 Dean:    <><>298361547_5366254896794262_1848679865055188135_n.jpg
2022-08-13 14:39:00.006 Dean:    I have one
2022-08-13 14:38:51.865 Dean:    good idea
2022-08-13 14:38:48.499 Dean:    [quote] Do you have anything to measure the capacity? [/quote] 
2022-08-13 14:38:39.015 Dean:

2022-08-13 13:37:00.458 Dean:    I am going to geess that it was from a washing machine
2022-08-13 13:11:26.644 Dean:    could not identify the part no.
2022-08-13 13:11:13.883 Dean:    I think you may be right but I've never encountered one like that before
2022-08-13 13:10:55.852 Dean:    [quote] Perhaps a noise suppression capacitor for a motor.   Or a capacitor from an induction motor. [/quote] 
2022-08-13 13:10:48.224 Dean:    and replacing with matching alternatives that are more efficient
2022-08-13 13:10:27.848 Dean:    I feel no guilt ripping out the internal connectors
2022-08-13 13:10:10.420 Dean:    without an upgrade
2022-08-13 13:10:06.108 Dean:    so these old lamps are virtually useless now
2022-08-13 13:09:51.708 Dean:    the two batteries were joined by a copper strip with a sprung top
2022-08-13 13:09:25.001 Dean:    these old lamps use an original battery format that no longer exists
2022-08-13 13:08:35.859 Dean:    another couple of coats to go

2022-08-13 13:05:20.622 Dean:    I cannot remember
2022-08-13 13:05:01.756 Dean:    it is probably the missing part from your lift
2022-08-13 13:04:46.456 Dean:    I salvaged it but I forgot to mark what it was from
2022-08-13 13:03:33.123 Dean:    but it sits on the back of a power connector so it appears to be a strange can cap.
2022-08-13 13:02:59.744 Dean:    and it looks like a temp sensor
2022-08-13 13:02:45.742 Dean:    I salvaged it a while ago

2022-08-13 12:56:18.236 Dean:

2022-08-01 09:10:14.192 Dean:    they drag to the right or left at every touch as if they have something on the pad that is sticking to it

2022-07-30 12:00:34.671 Dean:    will drain and test shortly
2022-07-30 12:00:23.371 Dean:    worth extracting and saving
2022-07-30 12:00:14.642 Dean:    the two 18650s are newish and 3350mAh
2022-07-30 11:59:58.788 Dean:    I salvaged two 18650s from a battery extra charge pack that would no longer function, (dead board)
2022-07-30 11:59:00.596 Dean:    rained here too but I managed to save the washing
2022-07-30 10:05:27.331 Dean:    reboot
2022-07-30 10:05:23.002 Dean:    had to rebbot as my Dell would not wake up from a sleep
2022-07-30 10:05:11.080 Dean:    
2022-07-30 10:05:09.383 Dean:    Morning!
2022-07-30 10:05:08.229 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-07-29 22:58:10.608 Dean:    and I am adding fuses at the same time
2022-07-29 22:58:02.040 Dean:    and all the wires need to be cut/desoldered and remade
2022-07-29 22:57:45.182 Dean:    the battery structure (lattice) required some cutting and sawing
2022-07-29 22:57:07.536 Dean:    transferring a 15amp battery from an enclosure with an incorrect connector to a new enclosure with the correct type
2022-07-29 22:56:14.901 Dean:    working on a second ebike battery
2022-07-29 22:56:03.396 Dean:    
2022-07-29 15:39:08.410 Dean:    the train section is completely gone
2022-07-29 15:38:58.381 Dean:    lots seem to have been removed
2022-07-29 15:38:50.466 Dean:    I loved all the working Victorian replica models  in cases with electric and manually turned handles
2022-07-29 15:38:17.374 Dean:    not quite as good as it used to be
2022-07-29 15:38:09.370 Dean:    I love it there
2022-07-29 14:18:23.156 Dean:    all re-soldered, refitted, tested with 40 amp fuse - all good
2022-07-29 14:18:04.092 Dean:    re: my ebike battery
2022-07-29 14:17:35.577 Dean:    in Kensington?
2022-07-29 14:17:29.620 Dean:    when was the last time you went to the Science Museum?
2022-07-29 14:16:57.184 Dean:    the Rocket, I mean
2022-07-29 14:16:49.379 Dean:    Yup, I previously watched similar
2022-07-29 08:39:41.969 Dean:     Windspeed is 5 knots, force 2, direction NNE
2022-07-29 08:39:41.969 Dean:     Partly cloudy at 1400 ft.
2022-07-29 08:39:41.969 Dean:     Humidity: 68 %

2022-07-29 08:19:39.730 Dean:    of course it is Stephenson's Rocket that is at the science museum
2022-07-29 08:19:22.412 Dean:    
2022-07-29 08:16:38.391 Dean:    
2022-07-29 08:15:29.623 Dean:    so a little flux and a new soldered joint to fix and we should be back to normal
2022-07-29 08:14:56.784 Dean:    that the other battery does not do
2022-07-29 08:14:44.047 Dean:    that explained the occasional cut-outs
2022-07-29 08:14:30.077 Dean:    and the wire was held in place by a shrink wrap and the potting compoiund
2022-07-29 08:14:07.531 Dean:    the joint was only held by a mechanical push of the wire with a blob of solder helping it to fill the lug it was supposet to be soldered to
2022-07-29 08:13:21.328 Dean:    turns out it was a dry joint on the original soldering of the power line to the output connector
2022-07-29 08:12:55.932 Dean:    my ebike battery was not functioning after my fitting of fuses and new switch
2022-07-29 08:12:13.767 Dean:    Morning!
2022-07-28 17:55:53.749 Dean:    
2022-07-28 17:55:49.759 Dean:    I just have to resolve a mismatch between the array number and the listbox number
2022-07-28 18:31:09.618 Dean:    testing
2022-07-28 17:55:19.686 Dean:    the editing is almost working
2022-07-28 17:41:20.457 Dean:    on the bike
2022-07-28 17:41:16.509 Dean:    on my ebike battery I have added two fuses  and am about to test the latest fuse
2022-07-28 17:40:49.648 Dean:    
2022-07-28 17:40:47.115 Dean:    I will resolve whatever it screws up
2022-07-28 17:40:37.119 Dean:    I am going to be doing some testing of FCW editing lines, it may mess stuff up from time to time
2022-07-28 17:36:26.353 Dean:    I have seen that loco at the Science Museum
2022-07-28 17:35:57.178 Dean:    I like a trebuchet
2022-07-28 13:42:10.096 Dean:    ?
2022-07-28 13:42:07.981 Dean:    to any point in particular
2022-07-28 13:41:54.181 Dean:    let's hope it stays fine for you
2022-07-28 13:41:42.284 Dean:    good weather for it
2022-07-28 09:32:10.813 Dean:     Windspeed is 12 knots, force 4, direction E
2022-07-28 09:32:10.813 Dean:     Scattered clouds at 3100 ft.

2022-07-28 09:32:01.943 Dean:    
2022-07-28 09:31:32.349 Dean:    very useful
2022-07-28 09:31:27.263 Dean:    Thanks for that
2022-07-27 22:44:58.558 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-07-27 22:44:51.293 Dean:    thankyou
2022-07-27 22:14:14.172 Dean:    not the grey stuff which is hot glue
2022-07-27 22:14:03.691 Dean:    the white stuff

2022-07-27 22:13:34.677 Dean:    Actually we have two pictures already in the exchange folder
2022-07-27 22:12:18.161 Dean:    wilco
2022-07-27 22:06:57.053 Dean:    some coding achieved on the logic to edit text
2022-07-27 22:00:33.250 Dean:    I suppose I need to do some research on battery self-building forums
2022-07-27 22:00:04.449 Dean:    I have some acetone
2022-07-27 21:59:50.288 Dean:    but it returns too many products for proper hard potting
2022-07-27 21:59:22.292 Dean:    I have searched for potting compound
2022-07-27 21:59:13.656 Dean:    it would be very useful to know what it is
2022-07-27 21:59:02.945 Dean:    I will try to break some off
2022-07-27 21:56:14.811 Dean:    but flexible
2022-07-27 21:56:11.533 Dean:    and very strong
2022-07-27 21:56:07.762 Dean:    very adhesive
2022-07-27 21:56:02.766 Dean:    I feel it is a silicon of some sort
2022-07-27 21:55:44.520 Dean:    but it is much more likely to stick to shiny surfaces
2022-07-27 21:55:18.224 Dean:    it is like, in texture like a more brittle, more rubbery,  hardened hot glue
2022-07-27 19:53:56.822 Dean:    no odour
2022-07-27 19:53:20.691 Dean:    but it is not slimy at all
2022-07-27 19:53:11.734 Dean:    it is like a white silicon
2022-07-27 19:52:59.531 Dean:    do you happen to know what the compound might be?
2022-07-27 19:52:47.447 Dean:    rubberised
2022-07-27 19:52:42.542 Dean:    and semi-hard
2022-07-27 19:52:35.932 Dean:    it is white
2022-07-27 19:52:31.719 Dean:    and to hold the battery to the battery box
2022-07-27 19:52:15.061 Dean:    s
2022-07-27 19:52:13.485 Dean:    that has been used to secure cable in place
2022-07-27 19:52:00.900 Dean:    there is a lot of squirted 'potting compound'
2022-07-27 19:51:42.630 Dean:    in the ebike battery
2022-07-27 19:51:36.951 Dean:    
2022-07-27 18:26:57.372 Dean:    years ago
2022-07-27 18:26:45.507 Dean:    not modified it since it was completed
2022-07-27 18:21:19.575 Dean:    I'll see what I can do!
2022-07-27 18:21:13.943 Dean:    some time ago
2022-07-27 18:21:07.481 Dean:    I cannot remember if I added a date validation
2022-07-27 18:20:45.556 Dean:    and perhaps an extra validation on the date
2022-07-27 18:20:21.780 Dean:    I will have to add a log
2022-07-27 17:19:23.744 Dean:    but not a week!
2022-07-27 17:19:18.847 Dean:    so it can be out a few hours
2022-07-27 17:19:07.699 Dean:    it does not always get the chance to do so when I turn the laptop on and say hello
2022-07-27 17:18:40.203 Dean:    and it is set to do so automatically
2022-07-27 17:18:32.070 Dean:    but the weather tool automatically gets the weather whilst my laptop is on
2022-07-27 17:18:03.976 Dean:    perhaps I haven't done so
2022-07-27 17:17:56.034 Dean:    I don't think so
2022-07-27 17:17:51.034 Dean:    but have I failed to paste the weather for a week?
2022-07-27 17:17:35.079 Dean:    sometimes I have copied and pasted before I have refreshed
2022-07-27 17:17:13.000 Dean:    yes, but that's because I didn't do a refresh
2022-07-27 14:33:00.424 Dean:    FCW just working on the logic for editing a line and inserting it back into the output array
2022-07-27 14:32:22.443 Dean:    I have managed to do a little coding, first time for days
2022-07-27 14:32:08.497 Dean:    
2022-07-27 14:32:06.991 Dean:    Strange
2022-07-27 14:31:42.511 Dean:    
2022-07-27 14:31:33.526 Dean:    but I imagine it won't
2022-07-27 14:31:19.865 Dean:    maybe I could add a log if it happens again
2022-07-27 14:30:49.842 Dean:    too late to look now
2022-07-27 14:30:39.654 Dean:    I suggest from the time there was a problem with generating the data
2022-07-27 14:29:50.961 Dean:    it has the latest weather
2022-07-27 14:29:43.855 Dean:    and when the hourglass stops rotating
2022-07-27 14:29:28.509 Dean:    a double-click on the weather widget
2022-07-27 14:29:15.086 Dean:    before I sent it
2022-07-27 14:29:06.398 Dean:    I caused it to do a refresh of the data
2022-07-27 14:28:01.431 Dean:    That hasn't happened before and somehow I feel it isn't a programming error on my part
2022-07-27 14:26:25.533 Dean:    What happened there?

2022-07-20 22:32:26.648 Dean:    and then it can be placed in the roof
2022-07-20 22:32:13.343 Dean:    and they should all talk to it
2022-07-20 22:32:05.986 Dean:    they should have a router of their own in a place like yours
2022-07-20 22:31:37.761 Dean:    hopefully you didn't have to pay
2022-07-20 22:31:20.696 Dean:    just built for a 'typical' installation in a cinder block house with plaster internal walls

2022-07-19 10:33:01.985 Dean:    thunderstorms would be good
2022-07-19 10:32:52.625 Dean:    but I have managed to unblock the shower and do a shop, care for Mum &c
2022-07-19 10:32:31.305 Dean:    rather too hot to do anything

2022-07-16 16:02:17.028 Dean:    I do love it though
2022-07-16 16:02:09.330 Dean:    [quote] What a mess! [/quote] 
2022-07-16 11:31:51.030 Dean:    at least you didn't have to carry it
2022-07-16 09:23:22.622 Dean:    it has been days!
2022-07-16 09:23:13.096 Dean:    !still waiting for the district nurse to come
2022-07-15 14:54:49.557 Dean:    for editing the output file in FCW
2022-07-15 14:54:25.203 Dean:    some coding
2022-07-15 14:54:22.132 Dean:    
2022-07-15 09:21:46.337 Dean:    I would suggest it is only good for a 1 amp table lamp
2022-07-15 09:21:10.680 Dean:    I bought it largely to see if it fitted the description
2022-07-15 09:20:55.142 Dean:    the build is definitely not 10 amp
2022-07-15 09:20:38.896 Dean:    has no strain relief
2022-07-15 09:20:30.891 Dean:    bought another inline switch from a different supplier, supposedly 10amp with a lamp indicator
2022-07-15 09:19:52.791 Dean:    
2022-07-15 09:19:51.568 Dean:    sunny!

2022-07-14 10:17:47.003 Dean:    e
2022-07-14 10:17:45.763 Dean:    no temperature ris
2022-07-14 10:17:39.343 Dean:    and red
2022-07-14 10:17:35.685 Dean:    just the foot has swollen
2022-07-14 10:17:28.979 Dean:    no infection at site of wound
2022-07-14 10:17:13.998 Dean:    cut leg on chin 1cm
2022-07-14 08:20:18.236 Dean:    swollen foot
2022-07-14 08:20:15.003 Dean:    Mum poorly
2022-07-14 08:19:58.869 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-07-14 08:19:57.872 Dean:    Hello!
2022-07-14 08:19:45.561 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-07-13 19:28:16.636 Dean:    on the ebike battery
2022-07-13 19:28:08.993 Dean:    but still...
2022-07-13 19:28:02.862 Dean:    I know it is safe as there is no circuit
2022-07-13 19:27:51.000 Dean:    in the garden
2022-07-13 19:27:48.119 Dean:    cutting a power cable this evening
2022-07-13 19:27:39.342 Dean:    
2022-07-13 19:27:31.890 Dean:    it is rather a large motor-cycle-looking pushbike though
2022-07-13 19:26:21.909 Dean:    never had a push bike with a brake lamp before
2022-07-13 19:25:50.674 Dean:    meaning it chucks out a lot of light
2022-07-13 19:25:41.136 Dean:    but the light emits from the edges as well as the face
2022-07-13 19:25:23.875 Dean:    it looks like a much larger when fitted into the bullet lamp
2022-07-13 18:09:38.210 Dean:    the lamp incorporated into old shell, fitted, charged and running

2022-07-13 14:39:55.072 Dean:    in the middle of the glowing face
2022-07-13 14:39:20.395 Dean:    it is in a very strange place
2022-07-13 14:39:13.455 Dean:    cut a hole in the plastic lens so that the on/off button can be depressed
2022-07-13 14:22:46.563 Dean:    glued the lamp into the reflector with epoxy
2022-07-13 14:22:10.570 Dean:    I have drilled out the old rear lamp reflector so I can fit the brake light inside and access the charging port
2022-07-13 14:21:21.509 Dean:    it has multiple LEDs and is very bright and also quite small in diameter, just less that 2"
2022-07-13 14:20:33.311 Dean:    rechargeable
2022-07-13 14:20:28.376 Dean:    and when you brake the light shines bright
2022-07-13 14:20:15.884 Dean:    it has a movement sensor
2022-07-13 14:20:08.645 Dean:    purchased an automatic brake light with no external connections
2022-07-13 08:51:16.820 Dean:     Windspeed is 10 knots, force 3, direction NW
2022-07-13 08:51:16.820 Dean:     Scattered clouds + Mostly cloudy at 2500,4400 ft.

2022-07-13 08:51:05.302 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-07-13 08:51:04.116 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-07-12 13:46:30.562 Dean:    trial fit, not yet wired in

2022-07-12 13:46:16.501 Dean:    and finally the fuse on the side of the battery
2022-07-12 13:46:03.106 Dean:    
2022-07-12 13:45:54.087 Dean:    stops the wires from wiggling too
2022-07-12 13:45:37.514 Dean:    in a bike that is important
2022-07-12 13:45:29.776 Dean:    the potting is quite deep and is designed mostly to prevent mechanical movement

2022-07-12 13:44:36.216 Dean:    
2022-07-12 13:44:00.955 Dean:    There is the dodgy switch all gummed up with potting compound

2022-07-12 13:43:30.087 Dean:    This is the ebike battery being disassembled or separated from its case

2022-07-12 13:42:21.979 Dean:    without unplugging
2022-07-12 13:42:15.652 Dean:    this just allows any of us to turn the unit on/off easily when the charger shows green (fully charged)

2022-07-12 13:41:35.867 Dean:    I modified the power input on the 240-42v PSU to add a 5amp inline switch
2022-07-12 13:40:41.597 Dean:    
2022-07-12 13:33:47.249 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xasm3GFL7mM
2022-07-12 13:33:46.216 Dean:    found this interesting
2022-07-12 13:33:41.424 Dean:    
2022-07-12 13:33:32.215 Dean:    photos to come
2022-07-12 13:33:20.103 Dean:    so, I'll put a 40a fuse in it, cut the main wire, solder to the fuse wires and shrinkwrap
2022-07-12 13:32:39.883 Dean:    it fits
2022-07-12 13:32:34.087 Dean:    fitted a 40amp very solid inline fuse to the side of the battery to test fit with the case in place
2022-07-12 13:32:11.080 Dean:    
2022-07-12 13:32:10.205 Dean:    righto
2022-07-12 11:56:59.733 Dean:    that is when the problems occur
2022-07-12 11:56:51.502 Dean:    be careful going downwards
2022-07-12 11:02:17.102 Dean:    how are the other folks coping without the lift?
2022-07-12 11:02:01.598 Dean:    
2022-07-12 11:01:13.210 Dean:    if I can make it fit
2022-07-12 11:01:08.818 Dean:    it might work for the 40amp output fuse
2022-07-12 11:00:51.675 Dean:    and it was chunky
2022-07-12 11:00:45.880 Dean:    but I found only one  fuse holder
2022-07-12 11:00:32.969 Dean:    I looked in my parts bin
2022-07-12 11:00:23.043 Dean:    so, a little unexpected work and a short delay whilst I wait for the parts
2022-07-12 10:59:59.613 Dean:    I look at the other batteries I have and no fuses at all
2022-07-12 10:59:42.484 Dean:    I am surprised these batteries are not fused better than they are
2022-07-12 10:59:23.494 Dean:    seems sensible
2022-07-12 10:59:15.752 Dean:    40amp
2022-07-12 10:59:12.506 Dean:    I may also add one on the output
2022-07-12 10:58:53.062 Dean:    so I have ordered automotive inline fuse holders for blade fuses
2022-07-12 10:58:24.649 Dean:    
2022-07-12 10:58:22.680 Dean:    lots
2022-07-12 10:58:20.701 Dean:    lost of solder!
2022-07-12 10:58:15.641 Dean:    it was just as scary de-soldering and resoldering the fuse with all that heat and potential solder splashes
2022-07-12 10:57:35.856 Dean:    and that seems silly
2022-07-12 10:57:17.239 Dean:    but it was a 15mm square PCB with the wires and a blade fuse all hard-soldered
2022-07-12 10:56:53.218 Dean:    there was a fuse
2022-07-12 10:56:49.426 Dean:    so with the fuse removable then a circuit will be easier to work on
2022-07-12 10:56:24.218 Dean:    and solder splashes are a thing
2022-07-12 10:56:13.539 Dean:    it is a big amp battery at 36v
2022-07-12 10:55:54.981 Dean:    just so I can solder without fear of short circuiting
2022-07-12 10:55:31.555 Dean:    so I have ordered and am going to fit an inline blade fuse 5a on the input side
2022-07-12 10:54:59.596 Dean:    and that I am unhappy with that
2022-07-12 10:54:51.714 Dean:    I have realised that the battery has no internal fuses
2022-07-12 10:54:33.968 Dean:    I have paused on my battery switch repair
2022-07-12 10:54:09.959 Dean:    but only just
2022-07-12 10:54:03.647 Dean:    Morning!
2022-07-12 10:53:54.297 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-07-11 22:59:02.093 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-07-11 21:37:36.469 Dean:    reassembling now
2022-07-11 21:37:23.342 Dean:    then potted the whole thing
2022-07-11 19:40:11.373 Dean:    so much stronger than before
2022-07-11 19:40:00.462 Dean:    then expoxied it in place
2022-07-11 19:39:49.132 Dean:    then I shaped and glued a piece of plastic to separate the two lugs and prevent short circuits
2022-07-11 19:37:58.371 Dean:    which is how it failed before
2022-07-11 19:37:46.743 Dean:    after soldering I superglued the daughter board to prevent mechanical failure
2022-07-11 19:37:14.045 Dean:    s
2022-07-11 19:37:12.096 Dean:    but I saved it, unsoldered it and refitted it to the new input cocket
2022-07-11 19:36:52.107 Dean:    strange
2022-07-11 19:36:45.912 Dean:    and the lugs fit through slots in the micro PCB and fold around it
2022-07-11 19:36:19.872 Dean:    it fits on the back a standard 5.5mm 2.5mm pin jack DC socket
2022-07-11 19:35:39.343 Dean:    to allow perpendicular soldering rather than straight into the back
2022-07-11 19:35:02.858 Dean:    on the back of the input socket the designer of the bike has mounted a 10mm square PCB
2022-07-11 19:34:19.506 Dean:    
2022-07-11 15:19:03.033 Dean:    for desoldering
2022-07-11 15:18:43.097 Dean:    have to dismantle the case, remove all the potting compound, free the connectors pins
2022-07-11 15:18:09.740 Dean:    that is only connecting when the plug is at an angle
2022-07-11 15:17:40.339 Dean:    to replace the bayonet connection point
2022-07-11 15:17:21.905 Dean:    dismantling a battery for the ebike
2022-07-11 15:17:06.625 Dean:    
2022-07-11 08:58:16.559 Dean:    a restart was required
2022-07-11 08:58:09.336 Dean:    so it wasn't doing things properly
2022-07-11 08:57:57.940 Dean:    YWE died shortly afterwards

2022-07-09 09:58:49.918 Dean:    That would have damaged any real PM

2022-07-09 09:43:17.939 Dean:    I might devaite onto something more simple
2022-07-09 09:43:08.740 Dean:    so,
2022-07-09 09:43:05.521 Dean:    and fail repeatedly without being able to really put my head around the problem
2022-07-09 09:42:47.072 Dean:    so I don't want to start...

2022-07-07 21:32:02.292 Dean:    enough to burn

2022-07-04 13:15:46.496 Dean:    sumbing down?
2022-07-04 13:15:42.378 Dean:    strange
2022-07-04 12:41:59.019 Dean:    all that proposed expenditure 100 billion will result in more or less, very little
2022-07-04 12:41:29.512 Dean:    as they are top heavy
2022-07-04 12:41:23.612 Dean:    and just as expensive
2022-07-04 12:41:13.421 Dean:    they have less capable military than France
2022-07-04 12:40:53.894 Dean:    but their spend on new kit is a fraction of ours
2022-07-04 12:40:37.264 Dean:    their budget is greater or equal to the UKs 
2022-07-04 12:37:31.801 Dean:    and bound by the procurement process
2022-07-04 12:37:15.568 Dean:    it seems they are incredibly bureaucratic
2022-07-04 12:36:51.531 Dean:    whilst having some first class manufacturing
2022-07-04 12:36:30.509 Dean:    reading about German military and why it is so expensive and so incapable
2022-07-04 12:35:42.459 Dean:    that pocket guide might be useful to keep on a length of string hanging from the desktop workstation
2022-07-04 12:35:31.609 Dean:    
2022-07-04 12:34:59.620 Dean:    sound straightforward but it will be fraught with difficulties and if I can find a leg up that would really assist
2022-07-04 12:34:16.431 Dean:    the gap is the correct method and API to use to convert to a bitmap that is compatible with the dictionary object
2022-07-04 12:33:31.335 Dean:    I already extract icons in iconsettings and write them to a std picturebox
2022-07-04 12:22:51.217 Dean:    
2022-07-04 12:22:32.711 Dean:    this means that if you drag/drop to the dock it ought to be able to pick up embedded icons and if transparent will retain that
2022-07-04 12:21:51.368 Dean:     and I hope to make progress soon
2022-07-04 12:21:36.235 Dean:    I have put some probes out on the VB6 forum
2022-07-04 12:21:27.610 Dean:    which might be useful
2022-07-04 12:21:21.582 Dean:    I have sample code in C++ and VB6
2022-07-04 12:21:07.192 Dean:    I am researching which API I need to use and the arcane commands
2022-07-04 12:20:41.968 Dean:    if I have the bitmap then I can load that into the dictionary collection object I use to store the icons whilst SD is running
2022-07-04 12:20:06.984 Dean:    the next step is to extract and convert using that handle to a bitmap
2022-07-04 12:19:39.064 Dean:    I have some APIs to extract the icons that produce a handle
2022-07-04 12:19:23.233 Dean:    VB6 - SteamyDock - working on extracting icons from DLLs/EXEs
2022-07-04 12:18:51.596 Dean:    but nonoe of the qualifiers and utils
2022-07-04 12:18:41.677 Dean:    I retain
2022-07-04 12:18:37.408 Dean:    pwd, ls and ps as well as cd
2022-07-04 12:18:25.493 Dean:    but realised my other knowledge had simply evaporated
2022-07-04 12:18:10.109 Dean:    and I tried to navigate with some success
2022-07-04 12:17:57.406 Dean:    I have  a bash shell here
2022-07-04 12:17:48.653 Dean:    I was bemoaning my failure to remember my Linux commands only the other day
2022-07-04 10:34:35.004 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-07-03 20:38:44.636 Dean:    doing a big backup here
2022-07-03 20:38:38.429 Dean:    
2022-07-03 20:38:35.664 Dean:    should do
2022-07-03 19:32:39.203 Dean:    I know that the earthing rods are clamped
2022-07-03 18:52:16.741 Dean:    that was a joke...
2022-07-03 18:52:10.048 Dean:    you might have to weld them!
2022-07-03 18:51:32.732 Dean:    at 10mm
2022-07-03 18:51:29.009 Dean:    but you probably don't have enough copper
2022-07-03 18:51:03.959 Dean:    whitworth types
2022-07-03 18:50:59.566 Dean:    only very coarse threads might take on copper
2022-07-03 18:50:23.824 Dean:    or clamp
2022-07-03 18:50:08.982 Dean:    drill a hole?
2022-07-03 13:21:56.657 Dean:    reviewing your own code from a year or so ago...
2022-07-03 13:21:40.511 Dean:    so I have them clear in my head
2022-07-03 13:21:31.936 Dean:    re-analysing the methods I use to place bitmaps into GDI+
2022-07-03 13:21:05.412 Dean:    
2022-07-03 09:54:59.103 Dean:    we will have to see when the time comes
2022-07-03 09:54:48.229 Dean:    so I am hoping it would be legal to do so
2022-07-03 09:54:32.771 Dean:    and this is simple kit
2022-07-03 09:54:15.242 Dean:    luckily I have a captive gas engineer
2022-07-03 09:54:03.042 Dean:    yup!
2022-07-03 09:53:26.476 Dean:    I doin't even look anymore
2022-07-03 09:53:19.310 Dean:    I always used to look for the UK made alternatve and paid the additional
2022-07-03 09:52:55.675 Dean:    but I think you get what I mean
2022-07-03 09:52:44.502 Dean:     a poor example
2022-07-03 09:52:36.827 Dean:    so stuff just stops being made
2022-07-03 09:52:26.078 Dean:    but we aren't making things in general as we used to
2022-07-03 09:52:10.522 Dean:    and hack in another
2022-07-03 09:52:03.805 Dean:    I am sure I could do some gas plumbing if I knew what I was doing
2022-07-03 09:51:38.746 Dean:    and those are incompatible with mine
2022-07-03 09:51:26.870 Dean:    you just import cheap Chinese valves
2022-07-03 09:51:13.566 Dean:    we aren't making them because there isn't anyone around to make those valves
2022-07-03 09:50:41.723 Dean:    will be taken out when that valve finally fails
2022-07-03 09:50:24.305 Dean:    so my solid iron Rayburn that should cook for 100 years
2022-07-03 09:50:02.108 Dean:    not making them anymore
2022-07-03 09:49:55.556 Dean:    valve UK made
2022-07-03 09:49:50.848 Dean:    I have a Rayburn that has a valve controlling the flow of gas
2022-07-03 09:49:09.656 Dean:    and I worry how much we depend upon China
2022-07-03 09:48:50.661 Dean:    China is becoming more assertive as it knows it can make everything
2022-07-03 09:48:25.017 Dean:    I think the US will find that out one day
2022-07-03 09:48:15.344 Dean:    it can find its economy at the whim of another master
2022-07-03 09:47:55.863 Dean:    and the others do not
2022-07-03 09:47:48.363 Dean:    but when one country has that manufacturing ability
2022-07-03 09:47:29.963 Dean:    that is good I suppose
2022-07-03 09:47:23.167 Dean:    as no country is self-sufficient
2022-07-03 09:47:11.680 Dean:    the world cannot afford to go to war with itself anymore
2022-07-03 09:46:57.769 Dean:    agreed
2022-07-03 09:46:45.081 Dean:    for most items
2022-07-03 09:46:36.780 Dean:    until it largely became impossible
2022-07-03 09:46:25.928 Dean:    I always bought British whenever I could but in the late 90s it became more and more difficult
2022-07-03 09:45:55.704 Dean:    and it will prove to be a mistake
2022-07-03 09:45:45.322 Dean:    we have placed ourselves in a global world where we obtain everything from foreign manufacturers
2022-07-03 09:45:14.600 Dean:    the lift -
2022-07-03 09:45:04.083 Dean:    
2022-07-03 09:45:01.396 Dean:    and I am getting getting closer
2022-07-03 09:44:52.834 Dean:    I am in the right area though
2022-07-03 09:44:44.546 Dean:    and in different languages!
2022-07-03 09:44:26.247 Dean:    but nothing quite applies
2022-07-03 09:44:20.411 Dean:    so I am having to extend my research to similar scenarios to see how others have accomplished similar things successfully
2022-07-03 09:43:46.659 Dean:    the trouble is that it is complex, andseveral peopl e have tried and I find their posts complaining that they could not do it, I see code from their failures but no follow up nor example code of anyone actually succeeding
2022-07-03 09:42:48.084 Dean:    but I am getting to grips with using examples from different languages
2022-07-03 09:42:31.766 Dean:    the command used are arcane, complex and beyond my current understanding
2022-07-03 09:41:56.764 Dean:    It seems that I need to read the icon data and et a handle to the data in memory and write that to a bitmap in memory and then read that into the same device context of the screen display
2022-07-03 09:40:48.763 Dean:    
2022-07-03 09:40:46.319 Dean:    a lot of functionality (the larger part) is undocumented
2022-07-03 09:40:21.118 Dean:    when it is needed
2022-07-03 09:40:13.126 Dean:    MS provides a lot but also very little
2022-07-03 09:40:00.369 Dean:    I have to find out how to place into the the device context of the screen directly using GDI+
2022-07-03 09:39:27.058 Dean:    but it outputs to a stdpicture box
2022-07-03 09:39:12.713 Dean:    and it allows me to see a icon in the dock
2022-07-03 09:35:04.762 Dean:    it works to a certain extent and I use it in the icon settings tool to extract and display an icon from a drag/dropped binary
2022-07-03 09:33:31.725 Dean:    at the time I used it, the only bit of documentation was in Chinese, later found someone utilising it using C with comment sin German I think
2022-07-03 09:32:15.230 Dean:    I have found a while back an undocumented API that extracts icons of all sizes from a binary
2022-07-03 09:31:29.555 Dean:    Windows embeds its programs icons within each EXE or DLL
2022-07-03 09:31:06.402 Dean:    coded last night, or rather researched how to do something
2022-07-03 09:30:39.986 Dean:    Clear sky
2022-07-03 09:30:15.353 Dean:    Morning!
2022-07-02 22:52:09.612 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-07-02 22:37:33.233 Dean:    and probably better
2022-07-02 22:37:28.251 Dean:    She will do just as well there
2022-07-02 22:37:13.598 Dean:    You are absolutely correct
2022-07-02 22:35:58.991 Dean:    I am actually quite excited!
2022-07-02 22:35:47.502 Dean:    and I need to do things like going to see my friends!
2022-07-02 22:34:43.993 Dean:    to the best of my ability
2022-07-02 22:34:35.416 Dean:    What I promised Dad I have fulfilled
2022-07-02 22:34:16.798 Dean:    My duty is done
2022-07-02 22:34:09.914 Dean:    and I'm not spending time with them
2022-07-02 22:34:02.809 Dean:    My children grew two years...
2022-07-02 22:33:53.116 Dean:    and I have other things to do
2022-07-02 22:33:46.746 Dean:    and although I am doing some coding here it is at 1/20th of the speed I should be 
2022-07-02 22:33:15.284 Dean:    I think, in reality that I have come to realise that my life is evaporating
2022-07-02 22:30:58.907 Dean:    so, have to get my head around the concept
2022-07-02 22:30:40.243 Dean:    with only one break
2022-07-02 22:30:34.598 Dean:    At that time proposed (December-ish) I will have been looking after Mum for two years
2022-07-02 22:29:59.468 Dean:    even though the decision is mine
2022-07-02 22:29:49.556 Dean:    I still can't quite accept or believe that might be happening
2022-07-02 22:29:32.720 Dean:    Let's organise later when Mum's new home becomes a reality
2022-07-02 22:28:46.768 Dean:    haven't been on a canal boat for decades
2022-07-02 22:28:30.235 Dean:    I'd love to see the boat
2022-07-02 22:28:21.949 Dean:    It is a definite possibility then
2022-07-02 22:25:57.324 Dean:    IS the boat out of the water every year? or every two/three years
2022-07-02 22:25:32.242 Dean:    so I suggest some time next year in the Spring/early Summer
2022-07-02 22:25:02.105 Dean:    it'll have to wait until we are all settled
2022-07-02 22:24:47.213 Dean:    It would be fun
2022-07-02 22:21:18.253 Dean:    it took ages
2022-07-02 22:21:12.112 Dean:    I have just added ALL the balloon tooltips
2022-07-02 22:21:01.032 Dean:    
2022-07-02 22:20:38.369 Dean:    but it ought to weld
2022-07-02 22:20:31.926 Dean:    and it may create a poor weld
2022-07-02 22:20:22.381 Dean:    it may not be very controllable
2022-07-02 22:20:08.995 Dean:    I don't see why it should not weld
2022-07-02 20:38:47.280 Dean:    and I'd love to see your set up
2022-07-02 20:38:36.579 Dean:    I just think we ought to meet at least once
2022-07-02 20:38:27.052 Dean:    as you are a carer and have multiple jobs to do
2022-07-02 20:38:14.768 Dean:    I wouldn't want to give you more to worry you
2022-07-02 20:37:27.824 Dean:    would that be too much of an imposition?
2022-07-02 20:37:19.572 Dean:    love to see your projects in the flesh as it were, and the canal boat
2022-07-02 20:37:00.440 Dean:    sometime in the following year
2022-07-02 20:36:49.094 Dean:    when Mum goes, going in a home at about Xmas I believe, would you take a visit from me?
2022-07-02 20:36:20.070 Dean:    I want to see it in action
2022-07-02 20:36:13.099 Dean:    I am very impressed you are actually building this
2022-07-02 20:35:59.079 Dean:    understood
2022-07-02 18:31:03.432 Dean:    sorting that out
2022-07-02 18:30:56.550 Dean:    I was unhappy with some of the fonts when greying out due to disabling
2022-07-02 18:30:42.287 Dean:    I am doing some tidying up of the GUI interface on the dock Settings tool
2022-07-02 18:30:26.473 Dean:    
2022-07-02 18:30:24.185 Dean:    :)
2022-07-02 11:55:01.260 Dean:    what are you planning to do with the Pico?
2022-07-02 11:24:17.973 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:24:15.975 Dean:    all's well with you?
2022-07-02 11:22:04.092 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:21:50.535 Dean:    and you keep the spreadsheet up to date as you go
2022-07-02 11:21:14.079 Dean:    and it really helps if all expenditure comes from the one account
2022-07-02 11:20:42.729 Dean:    so basic accountancy is required
2022-07-02 11:20:29.864 Dean:    if it does not balance you cannot submit it
2022-07-02 11:20:13.050 Dean:    so, you have to have a double-entry spreadsheet wit all the same categories of expenditure type
2022-07-02 11:19:42.784 Dean:    and it is merely a few boxes that you fiill in values
2022-07-02 11:19:26.207 Dean:    it is done by a web interface online
2022-07-02 11:19:13.103 Dean:    re: attorney, if it is similar to what we have to do, a yearly financial report has to be done reflecting all mum's income/outgoings that has to balance
2022-07-02 11:18:21.182 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:18:17.177 Dean:    looks good
2022-07-02 11:18:13.950 Dean:    [quote] Spent some time this morning ordering a new "Faucet Spray Head" for the kitchen tap. The original crapped out yesterday - not worth the bother of fixing it. [/quote] 
2022-07-02 11:17:41.758 Dean:    just touched Dave Rice via email to see what he has to say, he was searching on subversion for old source code last time we spoke
2022-07-02 11:17:08.940 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:02:42.678 Dean:    how do you handle that?
2022-07-02 11:02:32.541 Dean:    what do you use for source version control?
2022-07-02 11:02:15.262 Dean:    I did a little programming but reverted the code when I realised I was barking down the wrong tree
2022-07-02 11:01:50.018 Dean:    might be able to find some time to add more individual tooltips to the dock settings tool
2022-07-02 11:01:23.294 Dean:    
2022-07-02 11:01:18.234 Dean:    so, having completed it (whilst looking after mum)  is a weight of my shoulders
2022-07-02 11:00:24.300 Dean:    we had, after all, always done it this way for 8 or so years
2022-07-02 11:00:00.468 Dean:    we bought all Mum's requirements when shopping within our own all on the same card
2022-07-02 10:59:33.683 Dean:    so, having to dig back almost a year and a half ago to build a detailed picture of Mum's expenditure is jsut nor possible
2022-07-02 10:58:54.149 Dean:    as we did not know we would need to!
2022-07-02 10:58:46.340 Dean:    and we weren't keeping detailed financial records of expenditure
2022-07-02 10:58:29.394 Dean:    they wanted questions answering re: expenditure during a period after Dad's death when we were just coping with that and Mum's unexpected care
2022-07-02 10:57:48.640 Dean:    very pleased that is done
2022-07-02 10:57:13.323 Dean:    re: Mum's guardianship
2022-07-02 10:57:05.452 Dean:    late to bed last night after finishing the report to the Court of Protection
2022-07-02 10:56:31.147 Dean:     Windspeed is 13 knots, force 4, direction SSW
2022-07-02 10:56:31.147 Dean:     Scattered clouds at 3700 ft.

2022-07-02 10:56:22.273 Dean:    Done anything interesting worth telling?
2022-07-01 22:55:20.631 Dean:    worked most of the day on spreadsheets for the court of protection for Mum guardianship
2022-07-01 22:51:52.204 Dean:    no coding 
2022-07-01 14:43:13.051 Dean:    spent best part of four hours cleaning
2022-07-01 14:43:01.127 Dean:    after a big mistake from Mum
2022-07-01 14:42:51.196 Dean:    lots of cleanoing to do
2022-07-01 14:42:45.577 Dean:    bad day here
2022-07-01 09:21:50.546 Dean:    we tried it before and failed
2022-07-01 09:21:24.586 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-07-01 09:21:22.860 Dean:    Hello!
2022-07-01 09:21:15.757 Dean:    Well, encryption for firecall
2022-06-30 17:52:23.883 Dean:    startup manager -complete the graphics for that
2022-06-30 17:51:58.779 Dean:    get that signal widget working and tied to something, possibly network connectivity
2022-06-30 17:51:03.146 Dean:    add a rain alarm to the weather widget
2022-06-30 17:50:15.172 Dean:    Get all widgets to maintain/restore their position when an app goes full screen
2022-06-30 17:49:19.222 Dean:    create Panzer Moon Widget
2022-06-30 17:49:07.811 Dean:    Widget tasks:
2022-06-30 17:49:02.663 Dean:    
2022-06-30 17:48:49.717 Dean:    digest codes?

2022-06-30 10:56:03.925 Dean:    but I do not have time
2022-06-30 10:55:56.610 Dean:    it would look good on the desktop
2022-06-30 10:55:03.950 Dean:    combining the moon widget with one of the panzer gauges
2022-06-30 10:54:44.322 Dean:    I want to make a combined yahoo widget
2022-06-30 09:51:26.347 Dean:    it feels possible for my small brain
2022-06-30 09:51:06.089 Dean:    then I need to look at some examples as to how to do the same for the mouse hover event and see what I can do to pop up a balloon tooltip on controls that currently don't want to
2022-06-30 09:50:12.891 Dean:    VB6 came out before scrollwheels were a thing
2022-06-30 09:50:01.722 Dean:    on the scrollbars
2022-06-30 09:49:51.828 Dean:    then I can intercept, look at some values for mouse scrollwheel and then use those to set the vertical scroll
2022-06-30 09:49:20.206 Dean:    have to use some APIs to set tabs on certain controls and look for the messages going to/from the controls
2022-06-30 09:48:50.936 Dean:    it seems strightforward
2022-06-30 09:48:41.614 Dean:    and researching subclassing
2022-06-30 09:48:28.259 Dean:    changing the tooltips to balloon types on the 2nd pane of the dock settings util.
2022-06-30 09:48:08.385 Dean:    some small coding
2022-06-30 08:20:56.357 Dean:     
2022-06-30 08:20:56.357 Dean:     Light Rain

2022-06-30 08:20:35.740 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-06-30 08:20:34.272 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-29 22:56:41.536 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-06-29 09:11:24.127 Dean:    overcast here
2022-06-29 09:11:17.649 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-28 22:23:46.518 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-06-28 16:21:17.012 Dean:    needs a gas? supply
2022-06-28 16:21:02.261 Dean:    heating as you require it
2022-06-28 16:20:52.329 Dean:    are they cheaper to use?
2022-06-28 16:20:44.089 Dean:    in the old days many houses use to have one of those
2022-06-28 14:40:30.093 Dean:    the sub classing is a thing that advanced VB6-ers are quite used to so it may well be sensible to get it under my belt.
2022-06-28 14:26:22.078 Dean:    so I have to find another workaround or do the final balloons when all is done
2022-06-28 14:25:43.308 Dean:    
2022-06-28 14:25:40.964 Dean:    as it gives problems during development, crashing the IDE, not freeing up threads &c
2022-06-28 14:25:13.005 Dean:    it is the last thing you apply before shipping
2022-06-28 14:25:03.838 Dean:    but it is not a technology that you want to have active during development
2022-06-28 14:24:43.847 Dean:    I have a solution but it is a kludge and an extension of VB6 using sub-classing to catch messages to/from the control and add my code to them that way
2022-06-28 14:23:56.756 Dean:    but the dock settings tool uses a lot of them
2022-06-28 14:23:47.875 Dean:    not a problem on the ico. settings tool
2022-06-28 14:23:37.260 Dean:    The method I am using to generate the balloon tooltips does not work on drop down combo boxes
2022-06-28 12:27:44.622 Dean:    but over time it has won me over
2022-06-28 12:27:37.309 Dean:    I always thought TimeTeam was a bit ephemeral and lightweight
2022-06-28 12:27:17.491 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW3UQEDQ0zQ
2022-06-28 12:27:09.203 Dean:    watching time team in another window
2022-06-28 12:26:56.572 Dean:    
2022-06-28 12:26:50.910 Dean:    I've done it on the icon settings tool and FCW so, I now need to be consistent on the dock settings tool
2022-06-28 12:26:16.098 Dean:    I copy the tooltip text to the balloon text area and then later I will have to add some more colour and information to the balloon text, straight from the HTML help
2022-06-28 12:25:23.998 Dean:    painful to do
2022-06-28 12:25:03.379 Dean:    on one pane there might be 30 controls
2022-06-28 12:24:24.183 Dean:    I also have to modify the pasted code to include the control name
2022-06-28 12:24:00.194 Dean:    and adding code to the MouseOver event and then adding two bits of text to form the balloon title and text
2022-06-28 12:22:43.388 Dean:    this involves double clicking individually on each and every control on six panes
2022-06-28 12:21:47.184 Dean:    adding balloon tooltips to the dock settings tool
2022-06-28 09:14:47.625 Dean:    very silly
2022-06-28 08:41:47.524 Dean:    bright!
2022-06-28 08:41:41.224 Dean:     Windspeed is 5 knots, force 2, direction SSW

2022-06-27 21:56:41.677 Dean:    actually two!
2022-06-27 21:56:35.286 Dean:    I used to have a ex-gasboard Mini van
2022-06-27 21:56:23.526 Dean:    I know them well
2022-06-27 13:26:11.465 Dean:    so expensive now
2022-06-27 13:26:03.040 Dean:    great cars
2022-06-27 13:17:59.633 Dean:    on that Rover 75
2022-06-27 13:17:47.482 Dean:    a BIG job
2022-06-27 13:15:18.756 Dean:    the issue is unsprung weight as with the motors in the wheels  the weight has moved below the springs
2022-06-27 13:14:47.912 Dean:    but this is a single monolithic motor
2022-06-27 13:14:36.261 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R_aDtfwC2o
2022-06-27 13:14:33.881 Dean:    This chap did it with a Rover 75!
2022-06-27 13:13:11.397 Dean:    I know womeone who has already replaced his diesel engine with a single electric motor from a Tesla or similar
2022-06-27 13:12:40.810 Dean:    then it will be less of an issue
2022-06-27 13:12:27.739 Dean:    but as those become regular OEM replacements and 'normal' on most cars
2022-06-27 13:11:53.561 Dean:    yes, of course and certainly initially
2022-06-27 11:04:59.459 Dean:    
2022-06-27 11:04:56.263 Dean:    at least I didn't
2022-06-27 11:04:27.454 Dean:    LED lighting is a revolution that we did not anticipate
2022-06-27 11:03:58.250 Dean:    and goes in directions that can be unexpected
2022-06-27 11:03:48.246 Dean:    technology works in interesting ways
2022-06-27 11:03:33.035 Dean:    
2022-06-27 11:03:27.493 Dean:    (perhaps)
2022-06-27 11:03:21.431 Dean:    and you may be able to replace your wheels on an existing diesel car with in wheel motors
2022-06-27 11:03:01.715 Dean:    I think this technology will mature withon 5-10 years
2022-06-27 11:02:37.637 Dean:    they exist already for small electric vehicles but for the main motor of an electric car they are still using a single monolithic brushless motor such as in Teslas
2022-06-27 11:01:39.741 Dean:    https://www.proteanelectric.com/
2022-06-27 11:01:38.175 Dean:    the idea is that you can mount a motor on each wheel hub, replacing the current wheel, disc brake hub
2022-06-27 10:59:46.903 Dean:    but they are maturing and about to arrive in vehicles such as cars
2022-06-27 10:59:26.965 Dean:    we already have small in-wheel motors in smaller vehicles such as ebikes
2022-06-27 10:59:00.772 Dean:    another is in-wheel motors in automotive applications
2022-06-27 10:58:42.680 Dean:    
2022-06-27 10:58:31.664 Dean:    the arduinos are now quick enough to be able to do in software what a dedicated cpu used to do inside a car's engine computer
2022-06-27 10:57:45.473 Dean:    these were in their infancy a mere 7-8 years ago
2022-06-27 10:57:28.490 Dean:    and there are now open source projects for replacing the EFI system inside a series of high performance but now standard cars
2022-06-27 10:56:43.719 Dean:    vehicles have a computer heart for the engine itself
2022-06-27 10:56:20.939 Dean:    https://diy-efi.co.uk/
2022-06-27 10:56:19.437 Dean:    one interesting one (for me) is the Speeduino
2022-06-27 10:55:58.389 Dean:    new technologies:
2022-06-27 09:58:03.282 Dean:    
2022-06-27 09:58:01.190 Dean:    a weekly backup might be more sensible
2022-06-27 09:57:51.897 Dean:    so I have to keep pairing them down
2022-06-27 09:57:41.738 Dean:    daily backups take a lot of space cumulatively
2022-06-27 09:57:26.633 Dean:    
2022-06-27 09:57:00.450 Dean:    Now I have reminded myself I will set up that cron job
2022-06-27 09:56:42.269 Dean:    but I currently don't
2022-06-27 09:56:37.371 Dean:    I should do the same for email (thunderbird) 
2022-06-27 09:56:06.473 Dean:    as losing your browser profile can be just as painful and is vulnerable to file system, o/s and application corruptions
2022-06-27 09:55:24.698 Dean:    I have a schedule job that runs daily backing up the whole user profile to my 2nd drive
2022-06-27 09:54:52.495 Dean:    that store the whole user profile (which means everything in FF including passwords &c)
2022-06-27 09:54:22.058 Dean:    for tools like firefox
2022-06-27 09:54:13.620 Dean:    I won't let them
2022-06-27 09:54:09.028 Dean:    the user appdata folder, some apps like to install in there for some reason
2022-06-27 09:53:33.186 Dean:    no corruption other than what the file system might accidentally do
2022-06-27 09:53:11.500 Dean:    I sit all my documents under a \DEAN folder in the root of a drive away from the o/s drive
2022-06-27 09:52:41.754 Dean:    I put nothing of value on the desktop nor under any of the "my" folders
2022-06-27 09:52:14.385 Dean:    as user profile corruption is a serious problem
2022-06-27 09:51:50.818 Dean:    in that case just make sure nothing is under my documents &c
2022-06-27 09:43:29.614 Dean:

2022-06-27 09:41:54.454 Dean:    the value being stored in the registry
2022-06-27 09:41:36.860 Dean:    adding the capability for one of my msgboxes to have that "Do not show again" checkbox
2022-06-27 09:40:35.543 Dean:    vb6 ico. sett. bug-fixing (minor) and fettling for finalisation
2022-06-27 09:35:13.137 Dean:    fine here too
2022-06-26 22:06:28.018 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-06-26 10:10:01.968 Dean:    not too bad
2022-06-26 09:53:31.962 Dean:    3/8" 7 gbp
2022-06-26 09:53:19.623 Dean:    for 5/8" example
2022-06-26 09:52:49.827 Dean:    had a look on t'net and copper rods (earth spikes) are about 13gbp
2022-06-25 15:21:41.065 Dean:    so unless the benefit is significant it really is not worth doing
2022-06-25 15:21:07.826 Dean:    and then you need locks
2022-06-25 15:21:02.392 Dean:    and you need multi-threading to play with the cache in the background
2022-06-25 15:20:41.669 Dean:    mine is very simple but I can see some of the issues, you really need structure to keep track of the cached items
2022-06-25 15:20:08.892 Dean:    you did mention that cacheing introduces lots of potential problems
2022-06-25 15:19:45.353 Dean:    
2022-06-25 15:19:42.201 Dean:    which will certainlt do in the rare event of a deletion of an icon
2022-06-25 15:19:23.188 Dean:    and I have a workaround
2022-06-25 15:19:16.237 Dean:    I'll get to the bottom of it
2022-06-25 15:19:09.164 Dean:    and it appears not to have gone until a short time has passed
2022-06-25 15:18:40.985 Dean:    When it is cleared down by .clear you can still check the existence of an item in the list
2022-06-25 15:18:07.325 Dean:    I am sure it is
2022-06-25 15:18:04.200 Dean:    and whether it is really asynch.
2022-06-25 15:17:48.691 Dean:    The imageList I am using it not from Microsoft so I will be able to inquire from the dev how it does what it does
2022-06-25 15:17:03.681 Dean:    I just refresh the cache, set a flag not to use the cache, refresh the grid and re-enable cacheing
2022-06-25 15:16:24.636 Dean:    I have done a workaround for the deletion of a cached item from the thumbnail list
2022-06-25 15:15:53.697 Dean:    
2022-06-25 14:11:40.867 Dean:    copper is very expensive at the moment
2022-06-25 14:10:51.226 Dean:    sometimes, house ground insulators use copper rod
2022-06-25 13:25:56.243 Dean:    it is bloody annoying that is what it is
2022-06-25 13:20:11.888 Dean:    so difficult to test
2022-06-25 13:20:00.073 Dean:    only occurs in the binary form
2022-06-25 13:19:43.686 Dean:    and it acts differently in the IDE and in the compiled binary
2022-06-25 13:03:24.624 Dean:    I need to get it to report when complete
2022-06-25 13:03:07.564 Dean:    but that clearance is happening asynchronously
2022-06-25 13:02:51.162 Dean:    as the cache is maintained via an imagelist control I issue a .clear but it obviously takes some time to complete
2022-06-25 13:02:09.557 Dean:    this is despite clearing down the cache
2022-06-25 13:01:59.939 Dean:    when I delete an icon from the thumbnails it generates an icon already in the cache error
2022-06-25 13:01:28.690 Dean:    Doing some debugging

2022-06-24 19:17:22.237 Dean:    <><>forms-designer.png
2022-06-24 19:14:44.195 Dean:    probably c++
2022-06-24 19:14:31.474 Dean:    the DLLs are written in some form of C
2022-06-24 19:13:43.329 Dean:    as it is all provided in the form of DLLs
2022-06-24 19:13:32.806 Dean:    and can be created using VB6
2022-06-24 19:13:19.274 Dean:    very impressive
2022-06-24 19:13:15.398 Dean:    very good
2022-06-24 19:13:11.613 Dean:    for building forms with activeX controls
2022-06-24 19:12:52.362 Dean:    and it has a complete functioning drag and drop GUI designer
2022-06-24 19:12:32.574 Dean:    it has one built in
2022-06-24 19:12:24.569 Dean:    and it allows insertion of an external editor, I knopw how to do that anyway
2022-06-24 19:11:53.939 Dean:    so I found this https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12560/Form-Designer
2022-06-24 19:11:35.411 Dean:    is abnormal
2022-06-24 19:11:28.644 Dean:    and a transparent object without a traditional square shape
2022-06-24 19:10:47.152 Dean:    the concept of a graphic 'object' that can have any valid property and just needs code to be bound to events is not window-ish
2022-06-24 19:09:33.666 Dean:    meaning that they all build similar looking applications based upon standard controls
2022-06-24 19:09:02.310 Dean:    almost all windows designers make use of activeX controls
2022-06-24 19:08:47.849 Dean:    it will be not of any use to us
2022-06-24 19:08:39.214 Dean:    but
2022-06-24 19:08:37.455 Dean:    I discovered one
2022-06-24 16:21:31.112 Dean:    ah!
2022-06-24 13:43:33.158 Dean:    I am looking for an open source designer
2022-06-24 13:42:59.842 Dean:    not much better than that but it would be a  nice start
2022-06-24 13:42:47.135 Dean:    a double click on a control would take you to the associated event
2022-06-24 13:42:23.455 Dean:    attaching to a drag and drop designer
2022-06-24 13:42:12.768 Dean:    it is just a working example of something I could build
2022-06-24 13:41:50.285 Dean:    there will be lots of flaws
2022-06-24 13:41:42.200 Dean:    and see how it goes
2022-06-24 13:41:36.998 Dean:    drop some .js code into it
2022-06-24 13:41:24.744 Dean:    the search might work
2022-06-24 13:41:17.583 Dean:    the buttons are mostly trial
2022-06-24 13:41:09.230 Dean:    scintilla editor embedded within VB6 window
2022-06-24 13:40:48.780 Dean:    from trusted source
2022-06-24 13:40:43.763 Dean:    I just compiled this myself
2022-06-24 13:40:33.356 Dean:    <><>jsEditor.exe
2022-06-24 12:02:50.411 Dean:    looking good
2022-06-24 09:56:41.374 Dean:    just a small task
2022-06-24 09:56:38.224 Dean:    some coding to do today
2022-06-24 09:44:20.945 Dean:    just a few icon updates

2022-06-24 08:50:36.491 Dean:    That's great.
2022-06-24 08:49:11.520 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-06-23 22:38:32.218 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-23 18:45:21.359 Dean:    a little graphic work
2022-06-23 18:45:14.761 Dean:    no coding today
2022-06-23 18:44:49.740 Dean:    Ggod bless you my son
2022-06-23 18:29:00.297 Dean:    nice slippers
2022-06-23 18:28:57.315 Dean:    looking good
2022-06-23 09:32:10.390 Dean:    but she does not understand how useful it is to have stock
2022-06-23 09:31:57.535 Dean:    drives wife mad
2022-06-23 09:31:48.648 Dean:    I have a lot of junk wood!
2022-06-23 09:31:06.387 Dean:    it is now strong and flexible
2022-06-23 09:30:55.952 Dean:    without those the glue surface was quite small
2022-06-23 09:30:35.280 Dean:    I used the corner reinforcement to stop the box being crushed
2022-06-23 09:30:02.252 Dean:    and when made into a box would be hidden
2022-06-23 09:29:52.063 Dean:    I was not that worried as the ply I was using was slightly water damaged and discoloured
2022-06-23 09:28:37.069 Dean:    a bodge
2022-06-23 09:28:27.988 Dean:    I sanded it down and sealed it with PVA
2022-06-23 09:28:15.736 Dean:    my box was cut with a coarse saw so plenty of tearing
2022-06-23 09:17:26.162 Dean:    thiny ply is difficult to cut without some tearing
2022-06-23 09:17:01.908 Dean:    looking good
2022-06-23 08:52:48.686 Dean:    60% chance of rain here
2022-06-23 08:52:39.505 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-06-22 11:40:56.754 Dean:    my digital sinclair meter
2022-06-22 11:40:37.068 Dean:    box prior to finishing/sanding
2022-06-22 11:39:52.325 Dean:    <><>sinclair0001.jpg
2022-06-22 11:39:47.644 Dean:    <><>box001.jpg
2022-06-22 11:20:15.412 Dean:    it worked well
2022-06-22 11:20:10.267 Dean:    then let the PVA dry
2022-06-22 11:19:58.886 Dean:    I  hand held the plywood for 5mins until the UHU grabbed
2022-06-22 11:19:37.695 Dean:    so I used UHU on 1" square portions, separated from the PVA
2022-06-22 11:19:10.302 Dean:    and could not find the clamps!
2022-06-22 11:19:03.695 Dean:    I had to build some new pannier boxes from 3mm plywood with 1/4 dowel as corner reinforcement
2022-06-22 11:05:40.904 Dean:    it will improve the flow and design of VB6 projects
2022-06-22 11:05:19.259 Dean:    
2022-06-22 11:05:02.115 Dean:    nice to have a feature that most other languages can do by default
2022-06-22 11:04:38.254 Dean:    Now, though. TwinBasic, one of the two planned successors to VB6 is able to build DLLs
2022-06-22 11:04:02.594 Dean:    
2022-06-22 11:03:46.013 Dean:    a limitation...
2022-06-22 11:03:42.155 Dean:    
2022-06-22 11:03:38.018 Dean:    you can reference external DLLs of course but they have to be written in C or C++
2022-06-22 11:03:13.025 Dean:    for all shared code it has to be placed in shared modules that are compiled into the main binary
2022-06-22 11:02:38.547 Dean:    but a normal DLL, it does not have that capability
2022-06-22 11:02:24.009 Dean:    it can build COM/ActiveX exposed DLLs
2022-06-22 11:02:05.307 Dean:    it does not have the capability to create normal DLLs
2022-06-22 11:01:50.177 Dean:    VB6
2022-06-22 11:01:48.554 Dean:    
2022-06-22 10:52:10.847 Dean:    but it is expensive in comparison
2022-06-22 10:52:02.514 Dean:    the UHU dries quickly being solvent based
2022-06-22 10:51:52.644 Dean:    PVA is a good long term glue but has poor 'grab' when assembling
2022-06-22 10:51:23.455 Dean:    I found that when glueing I could use UHU at certain locations as it has a better 'grab' along with some good PVA for the majority
2022-06-22 10:50:05.826 Dean:    which?
2022-06-22 10:50:03.475 Dean:    how will you assemble, glue?
2022-06-22 09:16:12.622 Dean:    watched the summer solstice sun go down
2022-06-22 09:15:54.791 Dean:    cycled last night from 9 until 10:45
2022-06-22 09:15:28.664 Dean:    making real progress
2022-06-22 09:15:24.370 Dean:    gosh
2022-06-21 13:32:33.823 Dean:    and hayfever-ish
2022-06-21 13:32:24.458 Dean:    tired
2022-06-21 11:37:08.570 Dean:    afternoon
2022-06-20 23:28:20.943 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-06-20 19:59:09.312 Dean:    keep me posted with photos
2022-06-20 18:04:36.861 Dean:    you definitely need something that can interrupt the power before it spot welds the electrodes
2022-06-20 18:01:14.180 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwocVH3_1Eo&t=0s
2022-06-20 15:54:09.446 Dean:    probably pre-built on ebay
2022-06-20 15:53:59.662 Dean:    for exactly this application
2022-06-20 15:53:50.430 Dean:    there are PCB designs to provide a timed control
2022-06-20 15:53:15.814 Dean:    relay sounds like a good idea

2022-06-20 11:03:52.287 Dean:    Hmmm
2022-06-20 11:01:11.871 Dean:    trying to remember
2022-06-20 11:00:49.242 Dean:    I presume the X,Y position is stored only per widget
2022-06-20 10:59:30.682 Dean:    Do we have a widget that can determine the position of other widgets without using tellWidgets?
2022-06-20 09:32:10.916 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-19 22:10:48.853 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-06-19 19:12:37.406 Dean:    nothing wrong with that

2022-06-19 09:35:07.474 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-06-18 22:36:40.634 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-06-18 21:01:11.155 Dean:    I think she is exaggerating
2022-06-18 19:31:03.922 Dean:    an intelligent set of viewpoints, informative
2022-06-18 19:30:47.311 Dean:    start at the beginning of the Ukraine crisis and listen forward
2022-06-18 19:30:24.336 Dean:    Telegraph podcasts on the Ukraine really worth listening to
2022-06-18 18:50:00.416 Dean:    and I feel happier having mine in a case with someone else passing the safety checks
2022-06-18 18:49:30.216 Dean:    that's a dangerous contraption
2022-06-18 18:48:41.889 Dean:    so my round tuit is largely unpolished and little used
2022-06-18 18:48:10.388 Dean:    and mum+ all the other household tasks
2022-06-18 18:48:00.016 Dean:    completion
2022-06-18 18:47:56.031 Dean:    Focussing on the ico. sett utility
2022-06-18 18:47:37.663 Dean:    as I am not using it generally
2022-06-18 18:47:30.674 Dean:    I can give you my round tuit
2022-06-18 18:47:07.537 Dean:    are you really going to make one?
2022-06-18 17:44:26.426 Dean:    but I bought one!
2022-06-18 17:44:20.536 Dean:    I've seen that method of generating a few amps and a makeshift spotwelder
2022-06-18 17:43:43.128 Dean:    That was the wrong way to extract good components from a microwave oven!
2022-06-18 15:04:55.147 Dean:    
2022-06-18 15:04:52.523 Dean:    in amongst doing everything else!
2022-06-18 15:04:40.906 Dean:    vb6 ico. sett generate tested the prepending icons automatically
2022-06-18 12:31:23.203 Dean:    now testing the prepend
2022-06-18 12:31:08.175 Dean:    feeling better at using it now, I thought I'd made it up for a moment
2022-06-18 12:02:26.628 Dean:    is prepend a real word?
2022-06-18 12:02:21.662 Dean:    next the pre-pend
2022-06-18 12:02:11.138 Dean:    vb6 ico sett. auto generate append tested and bugfixed
2022-06-18 10:49:37.285 Dean:    sounds as if the dev is having the same problems

2022-06-18 10:46:21.731 Dean:    Perhaps the environment will have matured over time
2022-06-18 10:46:02.488 Dean:    anything you needed had to be rebuilt from wireless drivers to applications
2022-06-18 10:45:35.672 Dean:    That is my criticism of Slax
2022-06-18 10:45:17.438 Dean:    to have to build
2022-06-18 10:45:10.397 Dean:    if you are going to dig into Linux it becomes a requirement
2022-06-18 10:44:54.137 Dean:    But
2022-06-18 10:40:23.674 Dean:    [quote] Porting Unix/Linux code to the Mac invariably involves running massive makefiles which never quite make it. [/quote] 
2022-06-18 10:40:16.438 Dean:    I'd agree with that
2022-06-18 10:39:31.734 Dean:    Linux Mint looking steamy

2022-06-18 10:29:30.872 Dean:    Slax is usable from a USB and is a slimline linux 
2022-06-18 10:29:01.198 Dean:    Kubuntu replaced that with KDE and all it's tools resulting in a powerful o/s with widget support  (not ours but plasmoids)
2022-06-18 10:28:07.540 Dean:    Ubuntu has a poor interface (Win 8-like)
2022-06-18 10:27:44.004 Dean:    I liked Mint and found it straightforward
2022-06-18 10:27:18.189 Dean:    Mint, Kubuntu, straight Ubuntu and Slax as well as Android on phones
2022-06-18 10:26:25.281 Dean:    I have had installations of the following varieties of Linux:
2022-06-18 10:26:03.400 Dean:    Yes
2022-06-18 10:26:01.389 Dean:

2022-06-17 09:47:32.952 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-06-17 09:47:05.090 Dean:    I will create a slicker version of that in VB6
2022-06-17 09:46:34.948 Dean:    should operate now
2022-06-17 09:46:29.595 Dean:    with the associated resources
2022-06-17 09:46:21.211 Dean:    that is the same binary within a folder
2022-06-17 09:46:07.370 Dean:    <f><f>rundialog
2022-06-17 09:23:36.037 Dean:    I will recreate it in VB6
2022-06-17 09:23:22.628 Dean:    can you please see if it works?
2022-06-17 09:23:15.061 Dean:    that was created in QB64
2022-06-17 09:22:49.652 Dean:    <><>RunDialog.exe
2022-06-17 09:22:17.873 Dean:    back on
2022-06-17 09:22:15.075 Dean:    internet died last night
2022-06-16 23:43:41.931 Dean:    testing to do the next two days
2022-06-16 23:43:28.846 Dean:    some coding, just a little, adding code to refresh the dock after regeneration
2022-06-16 23:43:01.943 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-16 09:55:06.310 Dean:     I wanted to participate but some communities are too caustic to join
2022-06-16 09:54:39.119 Dean:     Felippe Heitor was a very nice person but he lacked the strength to control a whole community by himself. 
2022-06-16 09:54:17.765 Dean:    To my mind it was a mere matter of time before the community imploded or exploded. One or the other, and it did.
2022-06-16 09:53:40.980 Dean:    It looks as if the QB community is having its fourth rebirth after previous incarnations also died. QBASIC > QB64.net > QB64.org > QB64.com.
2022-06-16 09:52:34.864 Dean:    https://lunduke.substack.com/p/the-wild-events-that-nearly-took?s=r
2022-06-16 09:52:09.048 Dean:    I joined that community a few years ago but just as quickly left. It was full of politics leaking into normal discussions all the time
2022-06-16 09:51:49.601 Dean:    It seems that a BASIC community has just gone "tits up" and exploded in a eruption of vitriol. That being the QB64 community. QB64 is a recreation of QBasic from the 90s, a 64bit version of the IDE, compiler and language. It had a site (qb64.org) , WIKI, forum, codebank, discord server. Almost all were erased after a main contributor handed over the site to an unknown and discussion turned to argument, in turn to troubles.
2022-06-16 08:31:29.327 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-15 22:36:06.186 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-15 20:49:25.983 Dean:    tomorrow will test the prepend, overwrite and will add some flounces
2022-06-15 20:49:03.025 Dean:    the append appears to be working
2022-06-15 20:48:56.063 Dean:    
2022-06-15 20:45:45.380 Dean:    just testing the generate dock code
2022-06-15 20:45:20.056 Dean:    same as in my brother's top floor apartment
2022-06-15 16:23:24.684 Dean:    lovely and coool inside
2022-06-15 16:23:16.042 Dean:    several degrees more in London at the mo'
2022-06-15 13:06:21.231 Dean:    back
2022-06-15 12:16:48.864 Dean:    me too

2022-06-15 10:04:28.775 Dean:    beautiful here
2022-06-15 09:37:18.013 Dean:    straightforward, needs fettling
2022-06-15 09:37:03.714 Dean:    ico. sett. just added the code to auto generate a new dock from the registry/start menu chosen list
2022-06-15 09:36:24.294 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-06-14 22:14:32.655 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-14 21:56:04.871 Dean:    I know the area well
2022-06-14 21:51:26.156 Dean:    It was tasty
2022-06-14 20:06:50.170 Dean:    This eve. we had bacon bits fried, on top of a cheating pasta carbonara using linguini and cream as well as steamed brocolli
2022-06-14 20:05:46.148 Dean:    and the potatoes were mashed with cream
2022-06-14 20:05:33.500 Dean:    full of flavour
2022-06-14 20:05:22.617 Dean:    We had pork with chorizo and spice
2022-06-14 19:52:33.049 Dean:    different sausages though
2022-06-14 19:52:22.379 Dean:    we had that yesterday
2022-06-14 15:44:00.008 Dean:    sounds great and very clever, however I prefer a physical key
2022-06-14 15:43:36.902 Dean:    [quote] I have a signet ring that contains an iButton - could, in principle, be used to open doors or use as an authenticator. [/quote] 
2022-06-14 15:36:01.838 Dean:    not familiar with those...
2022-06-14 15:32:40.481 Dean:    a while ago now
2022-06-14 15:32:29.883 Dean:    I used RIFDs in a project for various companies that had to test QoS for deliveries
2022-06-14 15:30:10.606 Dean:    business cards?
2022-06-14 15:29:19.941 Dean:    what will you use them to tag?
2022-06-14 14:34:23.253 Dean:    swine
2022-06-14 14:25:49.879 Dean:    just some tidying and fixing minor issues
2022-06-14 14:25:38.652 Dean:    tiny bit of coding
2022-06-14 10:23:13.755 Dean:    that needs to be in the icon settings resources folder as a subfolder
2022-06-14 10:22:55.458 Dean:    <f><f>sounds
2022-06-14 09:32:35.089 Dean:    will sort out the validation of a few vars
2022-06-14 08:33:39.814 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-14 08:33:38.204 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-06-13 23:49:43.231 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-06-13 21:15:31.743 Dean:    - but no errors!
2022-06-13 21:15:25.688 Dean:    and the generate dock utility does a little more, a backup then some code that you cannot see the results of
2022-06-13 21:14:41.959 Dean:    added some sound to msgboxes
2022-06-13 21:10:56.804 Dean:    they will be required for drag and drop icon targets
2022-06-13 21:10:33.792 Dean:    those document-nnn.png files I sentyou earlier should go in the C:\Program Files (x86)\SteamyDock\iconSettings\my collection\steampunk icons MkVI folder
2022-06-13 21:09:29.371 Dean:    still in test
2022-06-13 21:09:25.087 Dean:    mostly working
2022-06-13 21:09:14.778 Dean:    drag and drop from the desktop to the map
2022-06-13 21:09:03.747 Dean:    not much to test
2022-06-13 21:08:56.207 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-06-13 19:29:20.607 Dean:    Sausages, mash and peas
2022-06-13 12:21:04.936 Dean:    making changes now to add the required code to the generate dock routine
2022-06-13 12:20:39.602 Dean:    
2022-06-13 09:52:38.342 Dean:    The vb6 timer is very similar to the YWE timer
2022-06-13 09:40:01.914 Dean:    happy to use jscript or VB now
2022-06-13 09:39:41.990 Dean:    having used VB6 first it all seems quite familar to me
2022-06-13 09:39:27.238 Dean:    I am just going with the VB6 timer properties
2022-06-13 09:39:11.854 Dean:    I haven't tried emulating anything in YWE
2022-06-13 09:32:24.343 Dean:    finally settling on something you feel confident and happy with
2022-06-13 09:32:10.320 Dean:    that is the the trouble
2022-06-13 09:32:02.137 Dean:    [quote] There are many different ways of doing the same thing. My style has evolved - not sure it has settled. [/quote] 
2022-06-13 09:31:41.750 Dean:     similar to what you are doing
2022-06-13 09:31:25.403 Dean:    you have to code that yourself using timer APIs
2022-06-13 09:31:08.478 Dean:    and there is no form independent timer construct
2022-06-13 09:30:52.414 Dean:    they only run in the context of that form
2022-06-13 09:30:42.720 Dean:    that is convenient but
2022-06-13 09:30:29.862 Dean:    manner
2022-06-13 09:30:25.670 Dean:    so you drag timer controls to a form in the 'visual
2022-06-13 09:30:04.840 Dean:    the only main difference, a limitation is that they are tied to a form and not independent
2022-06-13 09:29:38.696 Dean:    VB6 has timer controls similar to YWE
2022-06-13 09:29:07.394 Dean:    setTimeOut?
2022-06-13 09:28:30.011 Dean:    essential
2022-06-13 09:28:27.234 Dean:    timers are very useful indeed
2022-06-13 09:26:03.128 Dean:    you only become familiar by working around the problems...
2022-06-13 09:25:36.394 Dean:    and wanting to try the VB6 way of doing things
2022-06-13 09:25:25.677 Dean:    partly this is due to teaching myself new things
2022-06-13 09:25:10.794 Dean:    [quote] It seems to be getting too complicated. [/quote] 
2022-06-13 09:24:21.830 Dean:    has similar happened to you?
2022-06-13 09:24:12.867 Dean:
2022-06-13 09:24:11.712 Dean:    then that realisation sets in ony when you encounter the new structure
2022-06-13 09:23:49.417 Dean:    and only later realise that the language has several alternative methods for dealing with a problem
2022-06-13 09:23:15.383 Dean:    and adapt that style to working in the newer language
2022-06-13 09:22:58.223 Dean:    Interesting though how one might start working in a different language in an older style
2022-06-13 09:22:01.358 Dean:    wilco
2022-06-13 09:17:21.277 Dean:    
2022-06-13 09:17:18.896 Dean:    or migrate to the in-built control?
2022-06-13 09:17:08.469 Dean:    would you leave as is?
2022-06-13 09:16:56.477 Dean:    there is no need.
2022-06-13 09:16:48.738 Dean:    but 
2022-06-13 09:16:45.099 Dean:    as the images are all the same size it would suit it too.
2022-06-13 09:16:22.265 Dean:    but the imageList would accomplish the same thing and be more elegant
2022-06-13 09:16:02.057 Dean:    I preferred this solution to a window of boxes that needed to be populated with large PNGs that need to be resized on the fly
2022-06-13 09:15:15.056 Dean:    but once they are loaded they are lightning fast to reposition
2022-06-13 09:14:45.300 Dean:    a bit clunky
2022-06-13 09:14:30.634 Dean:    and they are scrolled left and right as they physically exist beyond the frame of the application
2022-06-13 09:13:54.988 Dean:    at the moment I create picBox controls, one for each image
2022-06-13 09:13:25.536 Dean:    It could certainly be a replacement structure for the image map
2022-06-13 09:12:41.773 Dean:    but it is not to be.
2022-06-13 09:12:30.751 Dean:    I was hoping the imageList would prove to be a rather interesting item for handling pre-loaded image resources
2022-06-13 09:11:36.154 Dean:    so, I am back to picking up the images from the resources folder when I need them
2022-06-13 09:11:17.084 Dean:    adn that adds complexity that removes the need for a convenient store
2022-06-13 09:10:59.400 Dean:    and I'd have to know the original size
2022-06-13 09:10:47.746 Dean:    I can store various-sized images in the store but they are all stretched and I would have to resize them at run time
2022-06-13 09:10:20.871 Dean:    
2022-06-13 09:10:14.461 Dean:    just something I learnt about VB6, the same limitation is in VB.NET
2022-06-13 09:09:46.138 Dean:    but it removes the convenience of an image store
2022-06-13 09:09:33.508 Dean:    I could create a store for each common size
2022-06-13 09:09:19.047 Dean:    as all the images I would like to store happen to be various sizes
2022-06-13 09:08:52.861 Dean:    which is a right pain
2022-06-13 09:08:46.785 Dean:    tried it and found that all the images in an imageList need to be the same size
2022-06-13 09:08:29.769 Dean:    I am using imageLists as a cache already so I thought I'd set up a new one for image storage
2022-06-13 09:07:56.127 Dean:    there is the possibility of pre-loading them into a VB6 struct called an imageList at design time
2022-06-13 09:07:22.749 Dean:    but
2022-06-13 09:07:14.942 Dean:    I will put them in the resources folder shortly
2022-06-13 09:07:04.988 Dean:    those images exist ass .jpegs in the root currently
2022-06-13 09:06:45.534 Dean:    the correct image is put in place onto the associated control
2022-06-13 09:06:27.485 Dean:    if you select the light or high contrast themes
2022-06-13 09:06:12.131 Dean:    &c
2022-06-13 09:06:08.130 Dean:    *c
2022-06-13 09:05:57.405 Dean:    small visual buttons

2022-06-13 09:04:35.021 Dean:    Perhaps they have finally got their act together?
2022-06-13 08:44:12.020 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-06-12 22:00:48.995 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-06-12 21:04:45.471 Dean:    have to think about that
2022-06-12 21:04:38.181 Dean:    FCW did not handle that acute e very well in the filename

2022-06-10 22:42:52.223 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-06-10 22:42:51.739 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.

2022-06-10 21:00:46.251 Dean:    swine
2022-06-10 16:29:52.398 Dean:    more to do
2022-06-10 16:29:48.513 Dean:    just did some of that
2022-06-10 15:26:27.405 Dean:    
2022-06-10 12:42:49.427 Dean:    still trying to wake up though
2022-06-10 12:42:36.108 Dean:    bright
2022-06-10 12:42:31.950 Dean:    scudding clouds
2022-06-10 12:42:27.977 Dean:    lovely here too
2022-06-10 12:37:00.426 Dean:    bike ride, shopping, no coding
2022-06-10 12:36:38.547 Dean:    afternoon
2022-06-09 23:27:09.559 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-06-09 21:33:27.344 Dean:    email is going to make itself obsolete
2022-06-09 17:11:53.487 Dean:    going to get the washing in, the rain looks like it is on the way
2022-06-09 16:37:48.029 Dean:    no rain here, at least not yet
2022-06-09 13:26:31.460 Dean:    shoulders to the wheel &c &c
2022-06-09 13:26:20.140 Dean:    nose to the grindstone
2022-06-09 13:25:28.623 Dean:    cleaning, washing, sorting, tidying, putting away, drying, preparing, the usual litany from me

2022-06-08 21:51:22.002 Dean:    a normal day
2022-06-08 21:51:17.444 Dean:    and looking after Mum

2022-06-08 21:49:04.770 Dean:    and I fixed a minor bug

2022-06-08 21:47:04.379 Dean:    but I did create a few new icons
2022-06-08 21:46:56.434 Dean:    very little programming
2022-06-08 09:18:15.938 Dean:    seems far too complicated

2022-06-08 08:32:48.801 Dean:    So, MS has a 64bit version of VB6 that they will not release to the users...
2022-06-08 08:32:25.465 Dean:    can't be used to build standalone apps
2022-06-08 08:32:12.181 Dean:    no proper IDE
2022-06-08 08:32:06.490 Dean:    built directly from VB6
2022-06-08 08:31:58.207 Dean:    in a few ways it is superior, being 64bit and supported
2022-06-08 08:31:31.952 Dean:    MS Excel's in-built language is VBA, a super/subset of VB6
2022-06-08 08:30:45.173 Dean:    what is it about the things that you hate?
2022-06-08 08:30:43.687 Dean:    and only then when essential
2022-06-08 08:30:36.352 Dean:    I avoided using them for a long time
2022-06-08 08:30:12.365 Dean:    I hate spreadsheets too
2022-06-08 08:29:30.489 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-08 08:29:29.624 Dean:    Hello!

2022-06-07 22:38:46.232 Dean:    setting up email is the most complicated part of computing!
2022-06-07 22:34:25.125 Dean:    working?
2022-06-07 16:18:37.149 Dean:    just running it through some test cases
2022-06-07 16:18:27.571 Dean:    
2022-06-07 16:18:24.715 Dean:    I have drag and drop implemented in to the ico.sett. map

2022-06-07 13:23:20.521 Dean:    just cycled to the pub and back - fine weather
2022-06-07 08:52:04.304 Dean:    but warm
2022-06-07 08:52:00.028 Dean:    patchy

2022-06-06 19:41:49.028 Dean:    interesting typo
2022-06-06 19:41:38.840 Dean:    that is an intertesting idea
2022-06-06 13:10:07.099 Dean:    worth doing I think
2022-06-06 13:09:51.262 Dean:    
2022-06-06 13:09:47.728 Dean:    but definitely if it is raining
2022-06-06 13:09:37.726 Dean:    or possibly on another weather value
2022-06-06 13:09:13.529 Dean:    we need an alert if it is raining
2022-06-06 13:09:01.366 Dean:    YWE
2022-06-06 13:08:56.262 Dean:    on the weather tools
2022-06-06 13:08:48.065 Dean:    just thinking
2022-06-06 13:08:44.770 Dean:    
2022-06-06 11:29:40.392 Dean:    and defaulted the two folder selection buttons to open C:\program files if it exists

2022-06-06 09:43:02.059 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-06-05 22:14:56.005 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-06-05 22:14:54.139 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-06-05 22:14:53.292 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-05 21:03:32.986 Dean:    much more interesting things to listen to
2022-06-05 21:03:20.495 Dean:    youtube is now like the radio for me
2022-06-05 21:03:09.391 Dean:    in the background whilst I worked
2022-06-05 21:03:00.417 Dean:    watched lots of videos on youtube today
2022-06-05 20:34:16.136 Dean:    
2022-06-05 20:34:04.305 Dean:    but none of that is relevant
2022-06-05 20:33:56.508 Dean:    for slow systems
2022-06-05 20:33:48.957 Dean:    that were each massive in size
2022-06-05 20:33:28.213 Dean:    I would do it for 1,000s of images
2022-06-05 20:33:17.784 Dean:    and for little benefit
2022-06-05 20:33:09.018 Dean:    and we know that is where the problems start
2022-06-05 20:32:54.342 Dean:    and that would speed up the reading of the files  on a  re-opening of the app. but I would have to keep the files in the folder in synch with the cached versions
2022-06-05 20:31:53.983 Dean:    I could place the resized versions of the files into a separate cache folder but they would still need to be read as files from disc
2022-06-05 20:19:53.589 Dean:    
2022-06-05 20:13:25.473 Dean:    for very little benefit
2022-06-05 20:13:16.387 Dean:    and any attempt to cache prior to the user opening and navigating a folder feels doomed to conflict
2022-06-05 20:12:39.562 Dean:    so it all has to run in the same context
2022-06-05 20:12:28.972 Dean:    VB6 cannot multi thread
2022-06-05 20:12:19.659 Dean:    I've discarded my idea about creating a pre-fetch cache
2022-06-05 20:11:59.474 Dean:    
2022-06-05 15:16:20.117 Dean:    the trouble with clever people that it all comes with opinions and egos
2022-06-05 15:16:01.013 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:52:21.452 Dean:    that, to me is nothing to do with science and more to do with politix
2022-06-05 14:52:01.514 Dean:    The trouble with scientists is that they like to prove they are correct and present the 'facts' in such a way that boosts their argument
2022-06-05 14:16:02.435 Dean:    and it reads the cache size from file
2022-06-05 14:15:42.886 Dean:    it no longer clears the cache when you navigate from one folder to another
2022-06-05 14:15:06.303 Dean:    re: cacheing- I have added a refresh of the cache when the user presses the thumbnail pane refresh button
2022-06-05 14:14:15.839 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:13:52.954 Dean:    what that video DID prove was that there was no intelligence involved in the selection of fashion items work by the various people involved
2022-06-05 14:13:13.322 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:13:00.989 Dean:    to a standard that would meet his requirements
2022-06-05 14:12:41.889 Dean:    He probably hasn't yet been proven fully wrong
2022-06-05 14:12:11.312 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:12:06.607 Dean:    it is so easy to be wrong
2022-06-05 14:11:56.947 Dean:    not always a good idea to try to predict the future
2022-06-05 14:11:42.745 Dean:    That James LightHill
2022-06-05 14:11:35.957 Dean:    
2022-06-05 14:11:35.528 Dean:    
2022-06-05 13:31:30.975 Dean:    and I'll set the cache size through a variable set in the config
2022-06-05 13:31:11.420 Dean:    I'm not going to worry about the oldest item in the cache
2022-06-05 13:25:09.042 Dean:    so that potential worry needs to be addressed
2022-06-05 13:24:57.315 Dean:    the user can load any image folder into the icon collection tree
2022-06-05 13:24:38.333 Dean:    to prevent the app. trying to cache a folder containing thousands of images
2022-06-05 13:24:07.349 Dean:    I think I will limit the cache to n number of items
2022-06-05 13:23:53.898 Dean:    
2022-06-05 13:22:59.446 Dean:    I'll re-test on my olde core2duo sometime
2022-06-05 13:22:32.356 Dean:    a machine that runs significantly faster in general being a desktop
2022-06-05 13:22:10.300 Dean:    it is roughly the same when running on my i7 quad core 3.0g desktop with an SSD SATA 2
2022-06-05 13:20:43.063 Dean:    whilst less than one when scrolling up
2022-06-05 13:20:21.638 Dean:    the rotating hourglass has three or four revolutions when scrolling down
2022-06-05 13:05:50.981 Dean:    a scroll up is more or less immediate
2022-06-05 13:05:32.635 Dean:    reading 12x PNGs on a scrolldown causes a delay of approx. 1/2 sec
2022-06-05 13:04:49.490 Dean:    on my laptop i7 3.3ghz dual core, four threads and SATA 2 SSD
2022-06-05 13:01:41.324 Dean:    re: cacheing
2022-06-05 13:01:33.577 Dean:    
2022-06-05 13:01:30.262 Dean:    watching it now
2022-06-05 11:09:44.058 Dean:    I'm keeping it simple
2022-06-05 11:05:33.100 Dean:    late start for me
2022-06-04 22:46:12.594 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-04 22:23:30.601 Dean:    but somehow it seems wrong just to rely on faster CPUs and SSDs
2022-06-04 22:23:13.391 Dean:    I suppose it is unnecessary on modern PCs
2022-06-04 22:09:03.962 Dean:    and learning how to optimise the reading and display of  converted images using imageLists
2022-06-04 22:08:31.654 Dean:    I am just "doing things properly"
2022-06-04 22:07:59.528 Dean:    in my old E5400 with a 5400rpm HD the delay was noticeable but still acceptable
2022-06-04 22:07:17.275 Dean:    due to hardware
2022-06-04 22:07:10.631 Dean:    so what I am optimising is really well optimised in any case
2022-06-04 22:06:53.674 Dean:    modern machines are very fast
2022-06-04 22:06:43.830 Dean:    understood
2022-06-04 22:06:40.876 Dean:    yes
2022-06-04 22:00:43.209 Dean:    but scrolling back up will be quicker
2022-06-04 22:00:28.204 Dean:    scrolling down will stilll be slower as usual
2022-06-04 21:59:54.313 Dean:    when you open an icon folder in the treeview
2022-06-04 21:59:31.495 Dean:    thinking
2022-06-04 21:38:45.205 Dean:    have to think about that
2022-06-04 21:38:39.237 Dean:    hmmm
2022-06-04 21:08:02.126 Dean:    but if it works I will be happy
2022-06-04 20:42:59.693 Dean:    I'm expecting an error

2022-06-04 19:40:24.821 Dean:    thankyou
2022-06-04 19:40:21.602 Dean:    and tell me what happens when you run the iconsettings.exe?
2022-06-04 19:40:06.618 Dean:    ie. don't put it in the program folder, at least not yet
2022-06-04 19:39:36.791 Dean:    and leave the new ocx where it is for the moment
2022-06-04 19:39:23.300 Dean:    can you please place the iconsettings.exe in the usual place
2022-06-04 19:38:54.591 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe

2022-06-04 18:22:41.165 Dean:    mint salad
2022-06-04 18:22:29.246 Dean:    cooked here
2022-06-04 18:22:25.775 Dean:    we had a kebab
2022-06-04 18:22:21.013 Dean:    nice
2022-06-04 15:00:08.853 Dean:    I have a timer and a routine to check idleness
2022-06-04 14:59:29.491 Dean:    figuring how I will do the advance cache-ing
2022-06-04 09:38:15.844 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-04 09:38:14.611 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-03 22:25:11.594 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-06-03 20:36:18.728 Dean:    the imageList is in memory and the images are smaller
2022-06-03 20:35:48.939 Dean:    it loads into an imageList using a unique key
2022-06-03 20:35:33.352 Dean:    the cacheing is effective
2022-06-03 20:35:19.497 Dean:    I have to bundle that ocx in first to remove the previous error
2022-06-03 20:34:50.808 Dean:    I may add some pre-fetching
2022-06-03 20:34:38.150 Dean:    if it is in the cache then it uses it
2022-06-03 20:34:27.445 Dean:    if you open an image and it is not in the cache then it caches it
2022-06-03 20:34:10.763 Dean:    It is not pre-emptive
2022-06-03 18:31:40.422 Dean:    ico.settings cache -in implemented!
2022-06-03 18:13:27.085 Dean:    just waved her off
2022-06-03 18:13:21.951 Dean:    wife is out on the 5K town run
2022-06-03 18:13:08.798 Dean:    England is lovely in the Summer
2022-06-03 18:12:48.796 Dean:    that looks lovely
2022-06-03 13:52:13.273 Dean:    jelly and custard
2022-06-03 12:43:00.759 Dean:    i

2022-06-03 12:42:48.312 Dean:    cycled a bit today
2022-06-03 12:35:35.024 Dean:    lovely beers
2022-06-03 12:35:27.494 Dean:    picnic by the river for friends
2022-06-03 12:35:14.507 Dean:    a bit hungover
2022-06-02 22:38:24.422 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-06-02 22:38:22.924 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-06-02 22:38:21.909 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-06-02 19:46:01.580 Dean:    forgot to add it to the manifest
2022-06-02 19:45:46.353 Dean:    I know why
2022-06-02 19:45:41.071 Dean:    yes, understood
2022-06-02 10:06:03.190 Dean:    new version that does not need to refresh the map when dragging and dropping within the map
2022-06-02 10:05:33.172 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-06-02 10:04:47.923 Dean:    trooping now
2022-06-02 10:04:39.742 Dean:    Morning!
2022-06-02 10:04:38.744 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-06-02 10:04:37.392 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-01 22:24:56.952 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2022-06-01 22:18:04.910 Dean:    understood
2022-06-01 22:18:01.559 Dean:    [quote] I don't much care for pop concerts. [/quote] 
2022-06-01 21:54:28.810 Dean:    love trooping
2022-06-01 21:54:23.167 Dean:    agrred
2022-06-01 21:42:57.540 Dean:    been shopping today
2022-06-01 21:42:48.801 Dean:    picnic tomorrow in the garden by the river
2022-06-01 11:57:36.038 Dean:    also trying to determine if an imageList or a dictionary is quicker to use as a cache
2022-06-01 11:57:10.677 Dean:    vb6 ico. sett debugging, very few small bugs - I am having to try hard to break it
2022-06-01 11:56:44.583 Dean:    
2022-06-01 11:25:21.456 Dean:    and drizzly
2022-06-01 11:25:16.857 Dean:    afternoon
2022-06-01 11:25:12.842 Dean:    not good morning
2022-06-01 11:25:06.943 Dean:    Hello!
2022-06-01 11:25:03.101 Dean:    
2022-05-31 22:11:56.753 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!

2022-05-31 18:35:09.510 Dean:    whole system with all my widgets running and the pendulum uses less than 5%
2022-05-31 18:34:37.017 Dean:    I am running it on my core i7 3.2ghz
2022-05-31 18:33:26.090 Dean:    Do you remember the old pendulum on the old steampunk clock/calendar?
2022-05-31 18:32:30.499 Dean:    
2022-05-31 17:39:16.189 Dean:    I just have to tidy up!
2022-05-31 17:39:10.077 Dean:    Lucy is making it
2022-05-31 17:39:05.118 Dean:    spag. bol here
2022-05-31 17:38:52.933 Dean:    on a percentage scale, on an average basis? or by some other metric?
2022-05-31 17:38:29.932 Dean:    [quote] I am now officially alive! [/quote] 
2022-05-31 16:58:45.886 Dean:    quite stable
2022-05-31 16:58:37.179 Dean:    just had to restart FCW, unusual
2022-05-31 16:58:27.876 Dean:    
2022-05-31 16:58:16.121 Dean:    it should be
2022-05-31 16:57:20.800 Dean:    I have to balance the cost of writing into the cache is outweighed by the speed gained from reading smaller images residing in memory
2022-05-31 16:56:35.205 Dean:    still though, a speed improvement is not to be sniffed at
2022-05-31 16:56:18.463 Dean:    but my old E5400 with 2.7ghz cpu and 5400rpm HD, the delay was significant enough to notice
2022-05-31 16:55:39.096 Dean:    very little delay
2022-05-31 16:55:26.534 Dean:    as current systems do a lot of work with little end user impact
2022-05-31 16:54:58.416 Dean:    the CPU and SSDs make this rather academic
2022-05-31 16:54:33.343 Dean:    first steps in a cache
2022-05-31 16:54:24.493 Dean:    
2022-05-31 16:54:15.982 Dean:    and there appears to be no obvious penalty whilst doing so
2022-05-31 16:53:56.690 Dean:    so far I can write the thumbnails into an imageList successfully with a unique key
2022-05-31 16:53:21.461 Dean:    I am doing some investigation on the correct structure to contain the cached images, ie. it must be fast
2022-05-31 16:52:42.574 Dean:    the dock uses a dictionary object to store the images
2022-05-31 16:52:29.736 Dean:    much the same way as the dock itself (which I did much later)
2022-05-31 16:52:12.749 Dean:    so that subsequent displays of the same icon are much quicker
2022-05-31 16:51:53.008 Dean:    I feel the need to cache them
2022-05-31 16:51:40.470 Dean:    they are all read from large PNGs and resized
2022-05-31 16:51:26.698 Dean:    when we display the 4x3 grid of thumbnails
2022-05-31 16:51:11.094 Dean:    on the ico.sett. tool
2022-05-31 16:51:09.306 Dean:    
2022-05-31 14:45:08.495 Dean:    :(
2022-05-31 14:45:02.401 Dean:    [quote] Only problem, I think we are paying for it! [/quote] 
2022-05-31 11:26:54.651 Dean:    being white they really show the dirt
2022-05-31 11:26:47.175 Dean:    just cleaned the iKeyboard again
2022-05-31 09:14:17.319 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-05-31 09:14:16.129 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-05-30 15:57:03.290 Dean:    I get so jealous
2022-05-30 15:56:59.164 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl89zm4_yKc
2022-05-30 12:36:41.759 Dean:    It is progress
2022-05-30 11:56:29.992 Dean:    There is a multiplicity of these controls
2022-05-30 11:56:08.807 Dean:    all written by the same developer
2022-05-30 11:55:57.880 Dean:     and drop in place.
2022-05-30 11:55:50.246 Dean:    all open source
2022-05-30 11:55:45.603 Dean:    His imageList is part of a set of replacement controls that can be swapped in place of the originals supplied by MS
2022-05-30 11:55:11.616 Dean:    
2022-05-30 11:55:05.116 Dean:    I am sure the original dev will work on it, he has to add the conversion from a Hbitmap to an HIcon
2022-05-30 11:54:04.064 Dean:    which is acceptable
2022-05-30 11:53:55.871 Dean:    and now it is this
2022-05-30 11:53:49.540 Dean:    <><>rdmapbug03.png
2022-05-30 11:53:45.084 Dean:    it was doing that
2022-05-30 11:53:40.468 Dean:    <><>rdmapbug02.png
2022-05-30 11:47:06.688 Dean:    it produces a white box around the dragged image rather than the transparent icon as before
2022-05-30 11:46:36.585 Dean:    .picture property rather than .image
2022-05-30 11:46:24.908 Dean:    it uses slightly different syntax, I have yet to investigate what the difference is
2022-05-30 11:46:02.303 Dean:    I have a workaround for the imageList component that I want to use to store images that now works for the drag of an icon from the map or from the thumbnail list
2022-05-30 11:45:14.992 Dean:    
2022-05-30 10:49:09.945 Dean:    just
2022-05-30 10:49:06.944 Dean:    morning!
2022-05-29 21:10:24.018 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-29 21:10:22.649 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-05-29 16:28:23.683 Dean:    Seen that
2022-05-29 15:16:23.663 Dean:    I might have to live with using one control from Microsoft
2022-05-29 14:21:43.349 Dean:    same here
2022-05-29 13:47:14.937 Dean:    it will, as always, be more complicated than it should be
2022-05-29 13:46:55.628 Dean:    I have raised an issue with the forum
2022-05-29 13:46:26.183 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:46:21.531 Dean:    conversion to a transparent ico seems to be failing
2022-05-29 13:46:00.076 Dean:    if I use the 3rd party imageList it goes wrong somewhere and the result is a black square
2022-05-29 13:45:31.098 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:45:28.991 Dean:    and that is loaded to the dragIcon
2022-05-29 13:45:20.643 Dean:    then it is transferred to an imageList that converts to a usable BMP ico
2022-05-29 13:44:43.331 Dean:    it goes from PNG in file to a picBox using GDI+ to read and render
2022-05-29 13:44:13.776 Dean:    if I use the MS supplied imageList then it loads and extracts perfectly, providing the dragIcon in the map
2022-05-29 13:43:40.645 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:43:39.224 Dean:    Now successful in build but not yet in operation
2022-05-29 13:43:18.651 Dean:    so I am trying to avoid all MS OCX and instead building my own
2022-05-29 13:42:58.660 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:42:51.544 Dean:    as they made so many changes and shipped different functionality, breaking old in the process
2022-05-29 13:42:27.577 Dean:    but relying on MS supplied versions results in DLL HELL
2022-05-29 13:42:12.128 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:42:09.195 Dean:    or you can make explicit references to your own OCX when bundling
2022-05-29 13:41:29.773 Dean:    than linking to an external OCX that may or may not be present in that version
2022-05-29 13:41:08.613 Dean:    if you can embed your own code for a control within your binary it is much safer
2022-05-29 13:40:42.197 Dean:    a replacement for the MS supplied imageList
2022-05-29 13:40:30.911 Dean:    that OLEguids was required to build a copy of an imageList tool
2022-05-29 13:40:02.010 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:39:36.515 Dean:    Lucy bought me a treat, coconut and lime ice cream - it is disgusting
2022-05-29 13:39:17.588 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:39:12.108 Dean:    compiled fine since then
2022-05-29 13:39:03.617 Dean:    and point the project references to the updated version
2022-05-29 13:38:47.354 Dean:    had to deregister the old one
2022-05-29 13:38:34.571 Dean:    OLEguids.tlb
2022-05-29 13:38:27.970 Dean:    the type library on this version of Win7 was old
2022-05-29 13:38:11.508 Dean:    vb6 ico. tool, now compiles with the external imagelist I was testing before
2022-05-29 13:28:43.348 Dean:    
2022-05-29 13:28:41.538 Dean:    dealing with it now

2022-05-26 22:41:52.513 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-26 22:41:51.813 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-05-26 22:41:51.103 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2022-05-26 22:41:49.653 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-05-26 22:41:48.699 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-05-26 21:05:24.441 Dean:    and free of nags
2022-05-26 21:05:18.766 Dean:    it is free
2022-05-26 21:04:53.984 Dean:    I use it all the time to sync between systems
2022-05-26 21:04:24.969 Dean:    it runs on linux, Mac OSX and Windows
2022-05-26 21:04:09.949 Dean:    worth a looksee
2022-05-26 21:04:04.248 Dean:    https://freefilesync.org/download.php
2022-05-26 21:03:24.798 Dean:    freefilesync - do you use it?
2022-05-26 21:03:15.183 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:50:42.408 Dean:    but at the moment it works and is largely bug free
2022-05-26 20:50:29.674 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:50:26.285 Dean:    dynamically
2022-05-26 20:50:15.625 Dean:    and rather than unloading and disposing I thought it would be better to cache the things
2022-05-26 20:49:48.582 Dean:    at the moment it only holds 12
2022-05-26 20:49:38.428 Dean:    to speed reloading up when a PNG is read into the thumbnail list
2022-05-26 20:49:03.284 Dean:    I also want to cache icons in an imported imagelist control
2022-05-26 20:48:31.732 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:48:26.972 Dean:    but there are implications
2022-05-26 20:48:11.917 Dean:    but it can be done using something called subclassing with which I am unfamilar
2022-05-26 20:47:41.812 Dean:    then I want to find out if it is easy to display the balloon tooltips over the dropdown lists, currently it is not possible
2022-05-26 20:46:48.347 Dean:    then implement "2nd app to run" after the main app.
2022-05-26 20:46:25.156 Dean:    I have to add drag and drop to the dock from the desktop
2022-05-26 20:46:10.671 Dean:    
2022-05-26 20:43:32.996 Dean:    so I am going to do other projects for a while
2022-05-26 20:43:14.122 Dean:    I am a bit VB6-ed out for the moment
2022-05-26 20:42:53.483 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-05-26 14:13:00.969 Dean:    
2022-05-26 12:08:14.871 Dean:    The UI is working well
2022-05-26 12:08:04.480 Dean:    I will start working on the logic for creating the actual dock items next
2022-05-26 12:07:43.415 Dean:    all now working as expected
2022-05-26 12:07:36.321 Dean:    restart required
2022-05-26 12:07:31.220 Dean:    it was one of those strange bugs that affected the IDE operation
2022-05-26 12:07:11.853 Dean:    fixed that bug
2022-05-26 10:16:27.558 Dean:    so some investigation then I will give you something to test
2022-05-26 10:16:08.329 Dean:    always the way
2022-05-26 10:16:04.656 Dean:    but I have introduced a bug somewhere else!
2022-05-26 10:15:52.701 Dean:    it is now working how I want it to
2022-05-26 10:15:31.365 Dean:    I have to monitor the mouseUp/Downs
2022-05-26 10:15:14.548 Dean:    it was a pain as the dragicon was hard to control with multiple clicks on items in the found software list
2022-05-26 08:41:09.279 Dean:    tinkering with drag /drop between the lists still
2022-05-26 08:40:49.662 Dean:    
2022-05-26 08:39:07.179 Dean:    perfect outside
2022-05-26 08:38:55.041 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-25 22:42:46.597 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2022-05-25 22:42:45.724 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-05-25 16:50:15.092 Dean:    again, not as easy as you'd expect
2022-05-25 16:50:02.343 Dean:    generate dock util (GD) experimenting with dragging and dropping from one listbox to another
2022-05-25 16:49:28.657 Dean:    still good washing drying weather
2022-05-25 16:49:13.580 Dean:    and blowy
2022-05-25 16:49:08.812 Dean:    wispy rain
2022-05-25 16:49:04.226 Dean:    no sun at all here
2022-05-25 13:34:04.987 Dean:    I already have that code in the dock itself so I should be able to adapt it
2022-05-25 13:33:48.960 Dean:    I m intending to do the next of your suggestions, ie. drag and drop from the desktop to the map
2022-05-25 13:32:58.333 Dean:    Those are the 48x48 jpg icons that I have used in the custom msgbox that I rolled

2022-05-25 10:11:04.886 Dean:    mum is at respite care
2022-05-25 10:10:55.230 Dean:    very relaxed
2022-05-25 10:10:20.358 Dean:    New version, nothing to really note as the changes are behind the scenes, just balloon tips on the generate dock utility

2022-05-25 08:47:41.734 Dean:    my 'a' key is a little sticky today
2022-05-25 08:47:26.707 Dean:    was caught in  torrential downpour yesterday

2022-05-25 08:46:23.543 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2022-05-24 23:03:57.869 Dean:    it fixed one small bug where the current font was not auto-selected by the font tool when it first was raised
2022-05-24 23:03:07.873 Dean:    fixed a bug or two whilst it was being done
2022-05-24 23:02:49.307 Dean:    copied over the font selection method from FCW to icon settings to be consistent
2022-05-24 23:02:18.791 Dean:    legs tired
2022-05-24 23:02:14.808 Dean:    off to bed myself
2022-05-24 21:59:17.103 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-24 17:03:24.140 Dean:    was soaked

2022-05-22 16:46:25.170 Dean:    clearing the weeds from the garage door
2022-05-22 15:30:39.507 Dean:    adding balloon tooltips
2022-05-22 15:30:21.389 Dean:    working on the auto-generate dock tool
2022-05-22 14:05:03.465 Dean:    nice to be making progress
2022-05-22 14:04:47.740 Dean:    all takes time if you are going to do it properly and keep it in synch
2022-05-22 14:04:25.130 Dean:    and modified descriptions to the HTML help
2022-05-22 14:03:59.111 Dean:    documented my recent code changes
2022-05-22 14:03:49.739 Dean:    good progress on all fronts
2022-05-22 14:03:40.809 Dean:    lovely here
2022-05-22 10:10:33.627 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-21 22:13:01.519 Dean:    I will create some special icons to match the originals
2022-05-21 22:12:33.079 Dean:    and the constants are passed and understood
2022-05-21 22:12:20.615 Dean:    I have the message box image selection sorted
2022-05-21 22:12:08.041 Dean:    
2022-05-21 20:04:19.317 Dean:    I think all the values of  the various buttons have such a unique value individually that summing the values will always result in unique sum
2022-05-21 20:01:01.685 Dean:    can you think of a better way?
2022-05-21 20:00:51.508 Dean:    I can do it using lots of if statements
2022-05-21 20:00:37.705 Dean:    so, from the various potential values I have to determine the buttons and the image to show from the value passed
2022-05-21 20:00:08.300 Dean:    
2022-05-21 20:00:06.195 Dean:    the two together are 51
2022-05-21 19:59:55.537 Dean:    vbExclamation=48
2022-05-21 19:59:39.280 Dean:    vbYesNoCancel = 3
2022-05-21 19:59:07.926 Dean:    if I add this parameter as a vbConstant to my function it arrives as a numeric value consisting of a sum of the vbconstant values
2022-05-21 19:58:20.412 Dean:    each of those options results in a number that is delivered to the msgbox
2022-05-21 19:57:57.013 Dean:    other options might be vbInformation+vbYesNoCancel
2022-05-21 19:57:13.390 Dean:    this would produce a triangle with ana exclamation in it and also a Yes and No button
2022-05-21 19:56:37.762 Dean:    vbExclamation+vbYesNo
2022-05-21 19:56:21.242 Dean:    when I pass a vbConstant to a msgbox it is done in this manner as the second parameter
2022-05-21 19:55:40.085 Dean:    
2022-05-21 19:55:37.932 Dean:    https://flylib.com/books/en/2.688.1/section_b7_message_box_constants.html
2022-05-21 19:55:36.577 Dean:    can you look at this page?
2022-05-21 19:55:26.353 Dean:    Q. for you
2022-05-21 19:55:23.304 Dean:    
2022-05-21 15:24:47.428 Dean:    very good
2022-05-21 15:17:45.988 Dean:    the "display Info. dialogs" check box can be unselected to suppress message boxes
2022-05-21 15:17:13.384 Dean:    on the iconsettings I recently sent you...
2022-05-21 13:33:19.968 Dean:    using the most up to date version of Windows that it is practical to use.
2022-05-21 13:32:55.126 Dean:    At the moment I am unashamedly retro programming
2022-05-21 13:31:51.608 Dean:    long term stability - Linux
2022-05-21 13:31:19.099 Dean:    and realising Windows is the wrong path for developers unless you stay with Microsoft's latest and prepare for regular change/abandonment
2022-05-21 13:30:15.659 Dean:    At the moment I am banking on ReactOS for the long term
2022-05-21 13:29:45.710 Dean:    or a sandbox-in
2022-05-21 13:29:41.283 Dean:    if they implement security 'improvements' they at least need to provide an opt-out
2022-05-21 13:15:26.167 Dean:    unless they give me at the very least the option to configure back it again.
2022-05-21 13:15:00.863 Dean:    and woe betide anyone who comes in and changes it
2022-05-21 13:14:36.295 Dean:    I think of my 'puter and work environment as part of my house
2022-05-21 13:13:50.573 Dean:    whilst the host will be linux
2022-05-21 13:13:34.467 Dean:    and eventually I will sandbox those instance
2022-05-21 13:13:21.162 Dean:    and my Windows experience will be supplied by ReactOS/XP or Win7 64bit for more advanced functionality
2022-05-21 13:11:55.503 Dean:    at least the command line will be familiar
2022-05-21 13:11:46.014 Dean:    For me, I am being forced into Linux
2022-05-21 13:11:25.447 Dean:    is that it alienates in two ways
2022-05-21 13:10:58.620 Dean:    The thing about not having enough programmers and changing the UI each release without providing all the previous functionality
2022-05-21 13:10:02.324 Dean:    how crap is that?
2022-05-21 13:09:32.834 Dean:    so, Win 11 is never going to be for me
2022-05-21 13:09:17.536 Dean:    and that scuppers my use of my own dock program
2022-05-21 13:08:16.010 Dean:    the ability to place the taskbar to the top is missing with Win11
2022-05-21 13:08:01.727 Dean:    and features I need are missing from Win11
2022-05-21 13:07:37.309 Dean:    frankly there are SO many UI changes from 7 in classic mode to Win11 that for me it is like moving to another o/s altogether that happens to run some Windows programs
2022-05-21 13:06:39.489 Dean:    but ONLY when enough people complain - or avoid their latest offering
2022-05-21 13:06:21.734 Dean:    MS does often belatedly resolve the issues they resolve
2022-05-21 13:06:05.916 Dean:    until they get the hint
2022-05-21 13:05:53.366 Dean:    Well, with Microsoft's direction in general it suggests that you avoid Win11 altogether
2022-05-21 12:29:11.881 Dean:    worth a try if it knocks you out that much
2022-05-21 12:28:49.770 Dean:    Dietician might help
2022-05-21 12:28:35.660 Dean:    swines
2022-05-21 12:28:07.817 Dean:    and perhaps a word with a dietician?
2022-05-21 12:27:52.261 Dean:    might be worth bringing it up with the Doc
2022-05-21 12:20:18.088 Dean:    I am still working on the messagebox
2022-05-21 12:03:17.183 Dean:    but seems to be working
2022-05-21 12:03:05.149 Dean:    not tested in all circumstances
2022-05-21 12:02:50.889 Dean:    drag and drop from the icon images, from one part of the dock to another and hand-rolled msgbox

2022-05-19 20:14:07.419 Dean:    as the calendar must have been such an ephemeral concept to most
2022-05-19 20:13:35.596 Dean:    you have to be part of an advanced culture just to have people that understand it
2022-05-19 20:13:09.385 Dean:    even to come up with that calendar requires more than just memory
2022-05-19 20:12:48.242 Dean:    The Greeks were ingenious people then
2022-05-19 20:12:30.192 Dean:    agreed

2022-05-19 20:12:08.311 Dean:    and then it is time to migrate to Kubuntu I think
2022-05-19 20:11:44.688 Dean:    Win7 is my last development platform
2022-05-19 20:11:31.606 Dean:    and only then for testing
2022-05-19 20:11:25.738 Dean:    I have already decided that win10 is the last windows I will be involved with
2022-05-19 20:10:59.870 Dean:    you must be reading my mind
2022-05-19 20:10:50.326 Dean:    yes, I watched that previously
2022-05-19 19:27:23.126 Dean:    something for you to test shortly

2022-05-18 13:02:33.585 Dean:    cycled 1/3rd of the way to the coast
2022-05-18 13:02:22.290 Dean:    
2022-05-18 09:18:53.849 Dean:    morning
2022-05-17 22:25:38.055 Dean:    you can try and see how it works for you
2022-05-17 22:25:26.203 Dean:    you'll see when I package it for you
2022-05-17 22:24:22.599 Dean:    that leaves the icon in the target box to only go one direction, to the left
2022-05-17 22:23:25.493 Dean:    well, if I drag from the left it means that there is a hole to the left and I fill that by moving all the icons one step to the left
2022-05-17 20:18:44.236 Dean:    rather nice
2022-05-17 20:18:38.657 Dean:    ate a pasty in the country
2022-05-17 20:18:20.282 Dean:    
2022-05-17 20:18:19.159 Dean:    cycled half way to the coast
2022-05-17 20:18:06.359 Dean:    
2022-05-17 15:24:24.847 Dean:    it provides the phone with an additional twice the capacity of its original spec. power
2022-05-17 15:22:29.589 Dean:    that is the same size as the original but a little bit deeper
2022-05-17 15:22:16.042 Dean:    I have removed the plastic holder (glued to the leather) with a sharp knife and replaced the holder with a slimline battery powerpack
2022-05-17 15:21:20.890 Dean:    I have that model in a wallet with a holder that the phone itself is placed into
2022-05-17 15:20:56.300 Dean:    re: iphone 7
2022-05-17 15:20:46.999 Dean:    
2022-05-17 15:20:18.034 Dean:    or do you want the icon currently being dragged and dropped to appear on the box before that icon?
2022-05-17 15:19:30.681 Dean:    the icon to be replaced and that icon move to the left, down one position
2022-05-17 15:19:03.682 Dean:    do you want:
2022-05-17 15:18:58.260 Dean:    and drop it on a particular box already occupied by an icon
2022-05-17 15:18:37.243 Dean:    when you, from the left, pick up an icon and slide it to the right
2022-05-17 15:18:13.245 Dean:    icon settings tool
2022-05-17 15:18:07.001 Dean:    in the map
2022-05-17 15:18:01.249 Dean:    Q. for you
2022-05-17 15:17:56.512 Dean:    
2022-05-17 10:17:18.385 Dean:    off on the ebikje for an hour or so
2022-05-16 15:41:10.013 Dean:    washing on the line, blowing well
2022-05-16 15:40:58.516 Dean:    
2022-05-16 14:02:48.820 Dean:    feeling a little 'peeky'
2022-05-16 14:02:36.749 Dean:    I'm looking a bit rough today
2022-05-16 14:02:15.763 Dean:    and I see all the pitfalls through experiencing them
2022-05-16 14:01:53.243 Dean:    so it is inevitable
2022-05-16 14:01:47.919 Dean:    and adding functionality as I learn now
2022-05-16 14:01:35.919 Dean:    I am learning to implement things as we go along
2022-05-16 14:01:22.494 Dean:    this is where a lack of design and instead building on top of something that already exists is painful
2022-05-16 14:00:49.725 Dean:    to see if I broke anything
2022-05-16 14:00:42.502 Dean:    then testing
2022-05-16 14:00:33.398 Dean:    so all those need to be amended to call a separate routine that the click event also calls
2022-05-16 14:00:12.304 Dean:    I call the click event elsewhere and that now initiates a drag operation
2022-05-16 13:59:52.565 Dean:    there are knock-on effects on normal click operations that have to be dealt with
2022-05-16 13:59:30.998 Dean:    just ensuring I have the logic all done correctly
2022-05-16 13:59:19.495 Dean:    icon settings - still implementing the drag and drop within the map
2022-05-16 11:00:04.762 Dean:    sunnyish here
2022-05-16 10:59:56.128 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-16 10:59:54.147 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-05-15 19:18:48.682 Dean:    not much substance there
2022-05-15 19:18:37.134 Dean:    is this an official announcement?
2022-05-15 19:18:25.725 Dean:    looks like a load of wishful thinking to me

2022-05-15 14:35:22.341 Dean:    
2022-05-15 14:35:20.504 Dean:    so I am back to the drawing board creating a single combined and much faster function
2022-05-15 14:34:53.890 Dean:    my simple method worked fine but was too slow using existing add and delete functions
2022-05-15 14:34:29.831 Dean:    just doing a little work on reordering the icons on an internal drag and drop in the icon map
2022-05-15 09:59:54.785 Dean:    preparing for tonight's supposed storms
2022-05-15 09:59:46.195 Dean:    not so sunny
2022-05-15 09:59:40.376 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-05-15 09:59:34.191 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-14 22:28:49.000 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!

2022-05-14 21:47:06.298 Dean:    the evening has been lovely

2022-05-14 18:40:33.842 Dean:    lovely here
2022-05-14 14:03:17.709 Dean:    but the awareness of the explicit/non-explicit type conversions is something I have to remind myself to do
2022-05-14 14:02:35.274 Dean:    I have that on all modules
2022-05-14 14:02:28.690 Dean:    vb6 requires explicit type declarations when OPTION EXPLICIT is stated at the beginning of a code module
2022-05-14 10:54:51.259 Dean:    but I forget
2022-05-14 10:54:46.750 Dean:    it is something I do try to do as I code
2022-05-14 10:54:30.052 Dean:    perhaps not important on today's 'puters but I am busily going through the code 
2022-05-14 10:54:01.115 Dean:    and if you explicitly 'type' with a $ then it is quicker
2022-05-14 10:53:35.522 Dean:    the others without $ convert from a type to a variant/object and then back again
2022-05-14 10:52:58.791 Dean:    those with the $ are explicitly string typed 
2022-05-14 10:52:41.673 Dean:    and their equivalents left$/right$/mid$
2022-05-14 10:52:26.215 Dean:    there are statements such as left/right/mid &c
2022-05-14 10:52:09.198 Dean:    just been reading about explicit typing in VB6
2022-05-14 10:51:56.661 Dean:    the chores of life

2022-05-14 10:43:41.096 Dean:    a bit busy here

2022-05-11 22:35:08.033 Dean:    yes I bet

2022-05-11 09:31:38.107 Dean:     I could try various providers
2022-05-11 09:31:16.833 Dean:    probably security issues
2022-05-11 09:31:05.316 Dean:    cannot get mail to work on it though, not to the email servers I have access to
2022-05-11 09:30:19.538 Dean:    I might get another year on 3G
2022-05-11 09:30:08.349 Dean:    3G only - that will be gone from here soon enough
2022-05-11 09:29:53.307 Dean:    no SIM
2022-05-11 09:29:42.173 Dean:    without a connection
2022-05-11 09:29:33.277 Dean:    searches down to the postcode
2022-05-11 09:29:23.917 Dean:    nice to have a common tool
2022-05-11 09:29:14.134 Dean:    as I know the interface and its quirks
2022-05-11 09:28:55.349 Dean:    but I use navmii across all devices
2022-05-11 09:28:44.172 Dean:    I have it
2022-05-11 09:28:33.892 Dean:    the case is now rugged too
2022-05-11 09:28:22.654 Dean:    so, for £20 or so you can have a fully functioning bike console with 32gb of storage
2022-05-11 09:27:43.900 Dean:    GPS yup
2022-05-11 09:27:34.394 Dean:    directions, maps, speeds, music, dynamic night sky map, compass, weather, video camera when cycling, alarms for the home return  deadline, and internet access when on wifi in the pub
2022-05-11 09:25:10.114 Dean:    but it has transformed it into a perfect ebike console
2022-05-11 09:24:48.402 Dean:    (must be careful)
2022-05-11 09:24:39.949 Dean:    that can pair and provide me with background music when cycling
2022-05-11 09:24:25.071 Dean:    and a set of bluetooth headphones
2022-05-11 09:23:55.969 Dean:    I bought a £8 3000mWh battery that keeps it charged for ages and it has a solar panel on the back
2022-05-11 09:23:18.687 Dean:    the main issue was the battery drain
2022-05-11 09:23:11.553 Dean:    it is turning out to be a very useful device
2022-05-11 09:22:49.832 Dean:    I have found a very useful task for that old iphone as described (on the ebike as a console)
2022-05-11 09:22:14.430 Dean:    
2022-05-11 09:22:03.926 Dean:    recovering?
2022-05-11 09:21:59.938 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-05-11 09:21:53.559 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-05-10 10:10:55.437 Dean:    just trying to laugh...
2022-05-10 10:10:40.117 Dean:    oh bugger!

2022-05-10 10:09:39.454 Dean:    [quote] They no longer say "just a little prick" when you get the vaccine, etc. [/quote] 
2022-05-10 10:09:05.894 Dean:    not another endoscopy?
2022-05-10 10:09:00.994 Dean:    thjis is just the booster then
2022-05-10 10:08:48.223 Dean:    so embarassing
2022-05-10 10:08:35.590 Dean:    somethings you never forget
2022-05-10 10:01:16.094 Dean:    and it was a new and an embarassing experience for both of us
2022-05-10 10:00:55.349 Dean:    she was extremely gorgeous
2022-05-10 10:00:45.497 Dean:    I remember having to show my genitals (due to a fungal rash) to a brabd new doctor on her first day as a Doctor straight from college
2022-05-10 09:59:51.884 Dean:    but those people do it every day
2022-05-10 09:59:36.131 Dean:    it just lacks dignity
2022-05-10 09:59:24.710 Dean:    but I hope it is not too awful an experience
2022-05-10 09:59:08.068 Dean:    I can't say "have fun"
2022-05-10 09:39:11.832 Dean:    tired
2022-05-10 09:39:10.392 Dean:    yawning

2022-05-09 22:31:09.866 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire

2022-05-09 12:46:19.829 Dean:    I use it instead of  Wondows (sic) search as you know
2022-05-09 12:45:47.478 Dean:    I find it useful from time to time
2022-05-09 12:45:37.611 Dean:    under Windows, Effective file search has an option to not just find files but specific matching text in files
2022-05-09 12:44:54.314 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:44:18.344 Dean:    waste of time
2022-05-09 12:44:11.457 Dean:    I spent a good hour planning it and writing it in pseudo code

2022-05-09 12:25:19.152 Dean:    that is why it is good to have a store of code I suppose
2022-05-09 12:25:01.785 Dean:    you cannot even learn from your own mistakes and solutions...
2022-05-09 12:24:12.884 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:24:10.138 Dean:    How frustrating it is to realise that you can't teach an old dog new tricks
2022-05-09 12:23:48.786 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:23:47.917 Dean:    that there was an easier approach
2022-05-09 12:23:35.594 Dean:    I had done the same and had the same realisation
2022-05-09 12:23:17.867 Dean:    then I realised I had already had this whole train of thought when I created the earlier version
2022-05-09 12:22:47.591 Dean:    and that I had taken the more efficient route last time
2022-05-09 12:22:29.279 Dean:    so, I did that and realised there was much more efficient and incredibly easy method that  would takje 5 minutes and need no planning
2022-05-09 12:21:44.136 Dean:    
2022-05-09 12:21:41.394 Dean:    then I realised I had done something similar before and that I ought to look at it and perhaps take that code or that method at least
2022-05-09 12:21:02.429 Dean:    and commented it properly ensuring I really thought about what was required
2022-05-09 12:20:42.855 Dean:    I wrote out the spec in pseudo code
2022-05-09 12:20:24.955 Dean:    rather than me
2022-05-09 12:20:17.730 Dean:    trying to act more like you
2022-05-09 12:20:08.624 Dean:    I have just been doing some planning prior to writing some code
2022-05-09 12:19:52.756 Dean:    
2022-05-09 11:56:45.747 Dean:    mint humbugs are a good thing to starve upon

2022-05-09 11:56:11.275 Dean:    as none of us are getting any younger
2022-05-09 11:55:58.956 Dean:    but I thought it might be useful to raise it
2022-05-09 11:55:40.541 Dean:    a ridiculous conversation
2022-05-09 11:55:31.580 Dean:    
2022-05-09 11:55:15.772 Dean:    I am unsure anyone will care for my creations 
2022-05-09 11:54:56.738 Dean:    and I will carry on with it, giving you credit of course!
2022-05-09 11:54:37.497 Dean:    u
2022-05-09 11:54:35.339 Dean:    I'll make sire your code continues to exist
2022-05-09 11:54:23.269 Dean:    regardless of what happens
2022-05-09 11:54:13.805 Dean:    as I will look after it for you
2022-05-09 11:54:03.181 Dean:    then make sure I have all your code
2022-05-09 11:53:49.308 Dean:    I know this is a sensitive subject but if you ever feel that the medical buggers aren't looking after you and you feel you are failing...
2022-05-09 11:52:08.178 Dean:    better than the other end
2022-05-09 11:49:56.374 Dean:    ?
2022-05-09 11:49:54.397 Dean:    which end
2022-05-09 11:49:50.371 Dean:    poor you
2022-05-09 11:47:36.004 Dean:    as a trial
2022-05-09 11:47:31.119 Dean:    When I manage to obtain a Win10/11 machine I will join you with the web widgets
2022-05-09 11:46:48.511 Dean:    Send me screenshots as you manage to populate it with converted widgets
2022-05-09 10:58:37.896 Dean:    the widgets look best on my laptop
2022-05-09 10:58:26.272 Dean:    slow migration from YWE

2022-05-09 08:42:55.963 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-08 16:16:56.391 Dean:    The Worsley woman makes a few good documentaries
2022-05-08 16:15:47.683 Dean:    
2022-05-08 15:52:52.284 Dean:    I hope for more
2022-05-08 15:52:04.032 Dean:     occasional documentaries restore my faith
2022-05-08 15:51:50.814 Dean:    I used to love the BBC
2022-05-08 15:51:21.234 Dean:    and leave the social engineering behind
2022-05-08 15:51:02.192 Dean:    Kids programmes & documentaries
2022-05-08 15:50:40.643 Dean:    News and British films/drama
2022-05-08 15:50:23.757 Dean:    I think the BBC needs to refocus
2022-05-08 15:50:06.411 Dean:    radio 4 and youtube are my main places now
2022-05-08 15:49:42.142 Dean:    so it seems I am being transferred to the radio
2022-05-08 15:49:25.085 Dean:    I am white, middle class and in my 60s...
2022-05-08 15:49:08.192 Dean:    but the BBC is not for me now
2022-05-08 15:48:58.080 Dean:    plus a bit of music
2022-05-08 15:48:52.731 Dean:    documentaries and factual telly
2022-05-08 15:48:41.260 Dean:    I love intelligent dramas and histories
2022-05-08 15:48:17.200 Dean:    and is too politically correct for me to bear
2022-05-08 15:48:05.256 Dean:    I think it has dumbed down a few levels too far
2022-05-08 15:47:49.908 Dean:    used to be my channel of choice
2022-05-08 15:47:40.879 Dean:    almost none
2022-05-08 15:47:36.291 Dean:    I'm watching a lot less BBC these days
2022-05-08 15:47:00.117 Dean:    Later, I might add the code from SteamyDock that enables drag from the desktop to the map
2022-05-08 15:45:58.966 Dean:    ico settings tool - dragging from the dock now requires a mouseDown for x no. of ms before a drag is recognised - working well
2022-05-08 11:54:13.013 Dean:    any side effects from the jabs?
2022-05-08 11:53:55.366 Dean:    Good Afternoon!

2022-05-07 18:47:05.565 Dean:    Sounds good
2022-05-07 15:01:43.964 Dean:    then it is all new functionality, the auto-generation utility &c
2022-05-07 15:01:18.369 Dean:    one positioning fix to apply on the drop-down section
2022-05-07 15:00:54.872 Dean:    but I seem to have worked my way through them all
2022-05-07 15:00:38.777 Dean:    impossible I know
2022-05-07 15:00:33.397 Dean:    As far as I know, there are no bugs in iconSettings.exe
2022-05-07 15:00:12.432 Dean:    
2022-05-07 15:00:10.965 Dean:    so you can re-order easily
2022-05-07 15:00:00.775 Dean:    I am adding drag and drop within the map itself
2022-05-07 14:59:46.526 Dean:    very good
2022-05-07 14:59:44.016 Dean:    
2022-05-07 14:44:12.371 Dean:    not in any way important
2022-05-07 14:44:03.810 Dean:    when you next get a chance please test that iconsettings.exe

2022-05-06 16:40:18.979 Dean:    did she walk into something, I've done that
2022-05-06 16:40:01.134 Dean:    how did that happen?

2022-05-06 09:50:24.612 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-05 22:37:24.477 Dean:    and what with the delay with the click registering on the icon and stuff happening it seems to be about right
2022-05-05 22:36:57.034 Dean:    I tried various timings
2022-05-05 18:06:47.456 Dean:    all other clicks are just like normal, the drag requiring the briefest pause
2022-05-05 18:06:22.323 Dean:    so I added a timer, that counts to 50ms and if the mouseDown is still active after that period then the drag starts and the dragIcon appears
2022-05-05 18:05:32.958 Dean:    as it annoys
2022-05-05 18:05:29.048 Dean:    I don't want it to appear immediately on every click
2022-05-05 18:05:08.018 Dean:    iconSettings - the VB6 drag mode annoyed me, the second you mouseDown on a control the dragIcon appeared
2022-05-05 17:58:51.804 Dean:    strange to have a power cut these days in the middle of England
2022-05-05 17:58:20.224 Dean:    I see

2022-05-03 10:13:07.369 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-05-02 23:17:04.138 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-05-02 17:09:33.921 Dean:    cut the lawn with the min tractor
2022-05-02 10:50:51.579 Dean:    As you can change several via the drag and drop I have to change the process
2022-05-02 10:39:29.816 Dean:    dragging the icon to the dock is just the 'potential' of an icon image change
2022-05-02 10:39:03.196 Dean:    I may amend the pop up to say press SET
2022-05-02 10:38:32.209 Dean:    but I will have to find a change or two to suit the new operation expectations
2022-05-02 10:38:09.194 Dean:    but there is normal operation to press Set to make it semi stick
2022-05-02 10:37:05.038 Dean:    Part the way through
2022-05-02 10:36:50.421 Dean:    yes I saw that
2022-05-02 10:26:29.469 Dean:    Lucy said I slept through three fire engines
2022-05-02 10:26:16.433 Dean:    all good though

2022-05-02 10:06:44.199 Dean:    Morning!
2022-05-01 23:50:38.317 Dean:    I will amend the help with the various changes made recently
2022-05-01 23:50:25.782 Dean:    something for you to test tomorrow
2022-05-01 23:50:16.006 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-05-01 22:26:30.133 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2022-05-01 19:17:27.893 Dean:    I will add the code to drop it onto the map
2022-05-01 19:17:15.903 Dean:    good
2022-05-01 18:25:51.132 Dean:    I am using a new control that exists inside a MS OCX (dll)
2022-05-01 18:25:24.787 Dean:    please test at your leisure and let me know if there is an issue
2022-05-01 18:24:57.702 Dean:    <><>iconsettings.exe
2022-05-01 18:00:45.471 Dean:    
2022-05-01 18:00:43.759 Dean:    but I should have the drag and drop to the dock working by tomorrow if I have more coding time tomorrow
2022-05-01 18:00:16.199 Dean:    we'll have to see about that later
2022-05-01 18:00:08.213 Dean:    I will have to add some  simple animation to the dock to allow an extra box to appear or similar
2022-05-01 17:59:34.887 Dean:    soon
2022-05-01 17:59:32.122 Dean:    so drag and drop from the thumbnails to the map will be implemented
2022-05-01 17:59:03.708 Dean:    I should have the drop handled shortly
2022-05-01 17:58:54.923 Dean:    I have the icon selected, the drag handled, the drag icon is shown correctly (impressively so) and the drop event is registered
2022-05-01 17:58:09.994 Dean:    
2022-05-01 16:01:23.913 Dean:    
2022-05-01 16:01:21.301 Dean:    an icon drags successfully , I just need to capture and handle the drop
2022-05-01 16:00:52.574 Dean:    I have moved it to to the dragDrop event where it is run instead
2022-05-01 15:59:59.226 Dean:    not as easy as you would expect as dadding drag acapability to an icon disables both its click and mousedown events
2022-05-01 15:59:30.823 Dean:    adding drag and drop to the map
2022-05-01 15:59:20.922 Dean:    I have implmented one of your suggestions, partially in the iconSettings tool
2022-05-01 15:58:59.748 Dean:    
2022-05-01 14:55:33.529 Dean:    tidying up after yourself is vital!
2022-05-01 14:55:17.009 Dean:    anyway, done now
2022-05-01 14:55:03.627 Dean:    the issue was unfortunately obscured by various .setFocus to different controls and using a slider to store the main value
2022-05-01 14:53:51.967 Dean:    logging helped me find it
2022-05-01 14:39:32.884 Dean:    Doesn't it annoy you when a single one-line bug takes two days of your coding time to find and resolve?
2022-05-01 14:38:54.819 Dean:    
2022-05-01 14:31:29.376 Dean:    but the methof tracking down was complex involving add ing timers that set focus to specific controls to avoid clicking upon them
2022-05-01 14:30:52.655 Dean:    in the end the bug was trivial
2022-05-01 14:30:37.140 Dean:    which mde it hard to debug since each exit to the IDE changed the focus to the IDE
2022-05-01 14:30:11.539 Dean:    it was all on mousedowns and keydown events
2022-05-01 14:29:58.972 Dean:    during previous testing I added a line that bu"@@ered the logic
2022-05-01 14:29:34.162 Dean:    and it was my fault
2022-05-01 14:29:27.194 Dean:    found it
2022-05-01 14:29:24.712 Dean:    I had a real bugger of a bug to find

2022-04-30 21:38:11.123 Dean:    but mostly work on the house
2022-04-30 21:38:04.306 Dean:    a little bit of coding

2022-04-25 13:06:42.180 Dean:    just some thinking 
2022-04-25 13:06:35.996 Dean:    much better now and usable

2022-04-15 22:22:28.050 Dean:    testing the things shortly and we will ascertain what their characteristics are
2022-04-15 22:22:07.107 Dean:    looking into theLEDs that I have already
2022-04-15 22:08:33.643 Dean:    done now
2022-04-15 22:08:30.386 Dean:    oh well
2022-04-15 22:08:21.827 Dean:    even setting up the sheet, getting a year's worth of data in, receipts &c
2022-04-15 22:08:03.067 Dean:    the trouble is with those sort of bookkeeping tasks they can take hours to get just right
2022-04-15 22:07:37.187 Dean:    it balanced
2022-04-15 22:07:32.982 Dean:    just moved it and removed the duplicate, fixed the errors and all well
2022-04-15 22:07:09.491 Dean:    and a major duplication error and under the wrong category of £4,500
2022-04-15 22:06:31.394 Dean:    she had made a few minor errors in calculations
2022-04-15 22:06:15.827 Dean:    so I just itemised everything in tthe sheet and made it balance
2022-04-15 22:05:53.188 Dean:    and she was struggling making it balance
2022-04-15 22:05:41.091 Dean:    Lucy is the named person on the order
2022-04-15 22:04:37.586 Dean:    the report had to balance exactly and was itemised according to category and type of expenditure and income
2022-04-15 22:03:59.535 Dean:    then filled in a mult-page annual report
2022-04-15 22:03:44.066 Dean:    listing all mum's expecidures over the year
2022-04-15 22:03:29.474 Dean:    spent today building a double entry spreadsheet for the Court of Protection order for m Mum's care

2022-04-14 22:36:28.594 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-04-14 17:45:03.300 Dean:    I have my eye on 6v relays and that is my preferred solution
2022-04-14 17:34:17.268 Dean:    with family
2022-04-14 17:34:10.826 Dean:    down the pub - Suffield Arms
2022-04-13 20:01:58.837 Dean:    but Ywidgets does not unless you tell me otherwise
2022-04-13 20:01:45.321 Dean:    xwidget has a hide all option
2022-04-13 20:01:38.545 Dean:    
2022-04-13 20:01:22.797 Dean:    
2022-04-13 20:01:20.472 Dean:    I do not have a clue how I made that occur
2022-04-13 20:01:09.707 Dean:    but it would be very useful if it existed
2022-04-13 20:01:00.641 Dean:    I cannot reproduce
2022-04-13 19:59:38.363 Dean:     but there isn't one
2022-04-13 19:59:30.702 Dean:    it was as if a "hide all widgets" option had been clicked
2022-04-13 19:59:09.399 Dean:    I clicked on a widget in the dashboard and it appeared
2022-04-13 19:58:53.186 Dean:    but none could be seen
2022-04-13 19:58:13.333 Dean:    the dashboard was still there and the widgest were all running
2022-04-13 19:57:56.274 Dean:    just all gone
2022-04-13 19:57:51.764 Dean:    not heads - up display
2022-04-13 19:57:43.818 Dean:    and all the widgets disappeared
2022-04-13 19:57:35.310 Dean:    I clicked on the taskbar by mistake when clicking on something else
2022-04-13 19:57:15.493 Dean:    I did something strange
2022-04-13 19:57:09.048 Dean:    
2022-04-13 17:47:39.601 Dean:    I enjoyed my brief foray into widgeting
2022-04-13 17:47:28.179 Dean:    
2022-04-13 17:47:12.770 Dean:    getting my bike ready for a cycle
2022-04-13 17:46:50.659 Dean:    
2022-04-13 17:46:49.317 Dean:    I am painting widow frames upstairs
2022-04-13 17:46:38.363 Dean:    
2022-04-13 17:46:34.945 Dean:    12 feet wide

2022-04-13 16:49:25.614 Dean:    just stacked a huge pile of logs
2022-04-13 16:49:17.690 Dean:    
2022-04-13 15:06:45.875 Dean:    if you know of any useful off-the-shelf switchable circuits
2022-04-13 15:06:24.635 Dean:    and I want something that does the job
2022-04-13 15:06:12.418 Dean:    should be a couple of transistors and a resistor or two but PCB design skills are minimal
2022-04-13 15:05:14.652 Dean:    to control indicators
2022-04-13 15:05:07.006 Dean:    that I can put in a small box on my bike
2022-04-13 15:04:52.324 Dean:    I need a flasher unit for LED bulbs, low voltage
2022-04-13 15:04:34.604 Dean:    I was thinking about asking you to develop a simple circuit for me
2022-04-13 15:04:17.063 Dean:    
2022-04-13 15:04:07.436 Dean:    enjoyed the bug fixing
2022-04-13 15:03:55.014 Dean:    found the bug and fixed it
2022-04-13 15:03:48.148 Dean:    the media player widget font sizes on the playlist are incorrectly resizing
2022-04-13 15:03:31.251 Dean:    doing some .js bugfixing
2022-04-13 11:05:28.603 Dean:    I try to avoid using it hence win 7
2022-04-13 11:05:05.868 Dean:    and MS is always mucking about with them, trying to make them difficult to set up locally, forcing you to move to online account log on &c
2022-04-13 11:04:09.711 Dean:    when you experience a complete profile loss it will change the way you work
2022-04-13 11:03:52.859 Dean:    
2022-04-13 11:03:36.599 Dean:    as they were implemented by different teams from the chaps that built the core o/s
2022-04-13 11:03:18.646 Dean:    I do not trust these additional things that MS bolted onto Windows
2022-04-13 11:02:57.657 Dean:    all have lost files, synch'd incorrectly &c
2022-04-13 11:02:44.221 Dean:    In the past I have had sync. issues with briefcase, onedrive and the profile
2022-04-13 11:01:56.865 Dean:    just on the file system
2022-04-13 11:01:50.793 Dean:    and never in any MS structures
2022-04-13 11:01:38.544 Dean:    my files all reside on a separate data disc away from the C: drive
2022-04-13 11:01:18.929 Dean:    the downloads are redirected elsewhere
2022-04-13 11:01:03.841 Dean:    
2022-04-13 11:00:59.987 Dean:    p
2022-04-13 11:00:57.272 Dean:    and I am so good with backus
2022-04-13 11:00:50.856 Dean:    that is why I have multiple systems with the date
2022-04-13 11:00:39.591 Dean:     I have experienced it twice
2022-04-13 11:00:25.388 Dean:    and it does get corrupted
2022-04-13 11:00:14.981 Dean:    it seems to store its own indepndent file table for all files that reside under the profile
2022-04-13 10:59:41.883 Dean:    and if it is corrupted then all the files are dtill present but all will have 0 byte sizes and appear empty
2022-04-13 10:59:07.428 Dean:    the profile is a database with links to the actual location on the disc
2022-04-13 10:58:43.623 Dean:    where ALL data under the profile was lost
2022-04-13 10:58:29.689 Dean:    reason for this is a couple of catastrophic losses
2022-04-13 10:58:15.600 Dean:    I have no files under my documents &c
2022-04-13 10:57:59.339 Dean:    and it resides on an area away from the user profile
2022-04-13 10:57:46.263 Dean:    I always have a separate folder named DEAN
2022-04-13 10:57:31.204 Dean:    if you have your data and images, files &c under the profile then move them
2022-04-13 10:57:08.340 Dean:    FYI do not store any data under the user profile
2022-04-13 10:56:55.234 Dean:    
2022-04-13 10:43:34.103 Dean:    almost

2022-04-12 18:30:17.747 Dean:    as a visual reference
2022-04-12 18:30:04.982 Dean:    they will break when the connection is broken
2022-04-12 18:29:52.515 Dean:    and perhaps those cables at the bottom...
2022-04-12 18:29:37.672 Dean:    I am going to add a dialog box with a check box to go away for ever... to suppress the regular pop ups when Dropbox is not there
2022-04-12 18:28:56.768 Dean:    just ran FCW on XP no problems
2022-04-12 18:28:40.633 Dean:    does the back in doing the stacking
2022-04-12 18:15:14.902 Dean:    bought a lot of logs in case of high fuel prices in the Autumn
2022-04-12 18:14:53.899 Dean:    stacking logs
2022-04-12 18:14:46.785 Dean:    busy on top floor , repairing windows
2022-04-12 18:14:35.019 Dean:    all good

2022-04-11 15:53:26.472 Dean:    and a new icon for minimising
2022-04-11 15:53:17.260 Dean:    neither option does anything
2022-04-11 15:53:09.816 Dean:    new commands on the split lower window for edit and delete
2022-04-11 15:52:47.519 Dean:    nothing special
2022-04-11 15:52:38.940 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2022-04-11 15:51:48.668 Dean:    need to test the command first though on XP and Win 7 to see if it works
2022-04-11 15:51:19.400 Dean:    the signal will simply call a command line command to disable networking
2022-04-11 15:50:45.858 Dean:    tummy is now fine

2022-04-11 15:49:40.879 Dean:

2022-04-04 22:43:27.352 Dean:    the batteries are supposedly standard but mine requires two additional lug holes to be made, then the area reinforced due to the removal of plastic

2022-04-01 19:10:37.676 Dean:    I'll add the GUI elements to change those fields later
2022-04-01 19:10:24.973 Dean:    done now
2022-04-01 19:10:10.205 Dean:    more complex than thought as I needed to validate both the path and filenames to prevent weird chars getting in there
2022-04-01 19:09:32.477 Dean:    FCW simple change to store the backup and archive folder names in the settings file so that the locations of each can be set by the user
2022-04-01 12:33:57.320 Dean:    Ah good, keep me posted
2022-04-01 12:15:24.437 Dean:    but rather cold and windy
2022-04-01 12:15:18.446 Dean:    lovely and sunny here

2022-04-01 11:45:42.796 Dean:    Germany especially

2022-04-01 11:34:21.663 Dean:    W
2022-04-01 11:34:08.024 Dean:    Germany's nuclear Reactors, I sonder if they are still in mothballs?
2022-04-01 11:33:46.780 Dean:    and wean the EU more quickly from Russian resources than would otherwise have been
2022-04-01 11:33:05.271 Dean:    agreed
2022-04-01 11:26:32.291 Dean:    when I saw the Russians invading on at least seven fronts it was clear that they had made a miscalculation based upon over confidence and self belief, also fragmentation of command
2022-04-01 11:25:32.757 Dean:    all their plans seem to be short sighted and lacking even basic competence
2022-04-01 11:25:01.643 Dean:    but it feels if they are a little bu@@ered either way
2022-04-01 11:24:23.965 Dean:    I think the Russkis wanted to temporarily improve the strength of the rouble in its dire need
2022-04-01 11:23:41.898 Dean:    
2022-04-01 11:22:34.196 Dean:    I have added HEIC and HEIF to the listy of valid but unknown image types for FCW
2022-04-01 11:22:10.684 Dean:    does not allow VB6 to read them but a dbl click will open the photo viewer app that now recognises them
2022-04-01 11:21:43.332 Dean:    it appears to be a Codec that allows win7 to view HEIC files using win native tools
2022-04-01 11:21:10.075 Dean:    I installed copyTrans for windows that handles HEIC files
2022-04-01 09:30:38.811 Dean:    nothing at all in the news
2022-04-01 09:30:31.859 Dean:    no word in the news as to whether Germany bowed to Russian demands to pay for oil/gas in roubles
2022-04-01 09:29:27.208 Dean:    cold but bright here

2022-03-31 20:43:48.662 Dean:    so cheap
2022-03-31 14:58:31.100 Dean:    and then Windows can display it afterwards
2022-03-31 14:58:20.309 Dean:    for the moment I can enable it for a double click
2022-03-31 14:58:02.197 Dean:    they have a partial solution already, I just need to wait until it is mature!
2022-03-31 14:57:43.173 Dean:    I will hang around watching the VB6 users come up with a solution - it is on-going now
2022-03-31 14:57:19.133 Dean:    [quote] That's an installer for Pixillion which can convert images - free to use for home users. [/quote]

2022-03-31 09:47:19.026 Dean:    some people are making in-roads to reading them but the format is new to windows and still alien to VB natively.
2022-03-31 09:45:41.726 Dean:    HEIF files are not yet readable in VB6
2022-03-30 20:50:12.106 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire

2022-03-30 17:08:02.451 Dean:    I was calculating the form width properly but in the meantime MS changed everything again
2022-03-30 17:07:33.874 Dean:    the API gives a negative border width for some reason
2022-03-30 17:07:16.498 Dean:    they are mere templates on top of another window making regions invisible
2022-03-30 17:06:59.226 Dean:    on Win10 there are hidden borders and there is an API that has to be called to determine the width of these, they vary depending upon the aero theme type and some of them are also invisible
2022-03-30 17:05:41.340 Dean:    that worked well for XP - win 7
2022-03-30 17:05:23.041 Dean:    and scaleWidth which is just the form minus the borders
2022-03-30 17:05:02.982 Dean:    VB6 has width which incorporates the inner form and the exterior border

2022-03-30 10:43:52.319 Dean:    the code was running but its effects were not seen as I had a lockupdate command set previously that was not unlocked until after my code was run
2022-03-30 10:42:53.947 Dean:    and I realised that although I had code to prevent any seemingly duplicated lines (in reality remnants of the previous update that had not yet been over written)

2022-03-30 09:13:09.779 Dean:    Morning!
2022-03-29 21:57:10.649 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-03-29 21:57:02.006 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-03-29 21:56:55.829 Dean:    what you see is  not what you get
2022-03-29 21:56:34.213 Dean:    it seems there are hidden borders in win 10 and above
2022-03-29 21:50:20.931 Dean:    VERY useful
2022-03-29 21:49:51.413 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.2021
2022-03-29 21:42:16.425 Dean:    but we shall see
2022-03-29 21:42:11.828 Dean:    This should report the values of the borders under win10
2022-03-29 21:39:51.528 Dean:    thankyou#
2022-03-29 21:39:43.693 Dean:    please click on the little bevelled cover and report the values returned
2022-03-29 21:39:07.922 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2022-03-29 18:04:44.992 Dean:    supposedly a full charge costs approx 5-10p
2022-03-29 17:30:41.168 Dean:    it makes cycling 100% easier, more fun and you get somewhere very quickly so you go much further
2022-03-29 17:30:09.420 Dean:    (well not really but you get my drift)
2022-03-29 17:29:52.872 Dean:    in effect having 50%  stronger legs
2022-03-29 17:29:36.044 Dean:    providing 50% of the motive energy really helps the range of the bike
2022-03-29 17:29:08.692 Dean:    from a standard plug
2022-03-29 17:28:59.607 Dean:    possible less
2022-03-29 17:28:53.373 Dean:    but typically I observe charge times of 4-6hrs
2022-03-29 17:28:26.716 Dean:    recharging overnight, so I am unaware of exactly hw long it takes
2022-03-29 17:26:43.964 Dean:    this 36v battery is rated at 15Ah so 540wH so 1,944,000 joules?
2022-03-29 17:23:48.716 Dean:    typically 3.4kg
2022-03-29 17:02:04.531 Dean:    and the fact that I am still providing 50% of the motive effort
2022-03-29 17:01:45.531 Dean:    just me and the lightweight (in comparison to a car)
2022-03-29 17:01:20.716 Dean:    What makes the batteries on the eBike so good is that they have so little to move
2022-03-29 14:18:29.107 Dean:    I will analyse
2022-03-29 14:18:18.843 Dean:    perfect
2022-03-29 14:17:19.467 Dean:    oops
2022-03-29 14:17:12.139 Dean:    can you click that panel?

2022-03-29 12:11:01.687 Dean:    and then after as well
2022-03-29 12:10:56.435 Dean:    before a resize
2022-03-29 12:10:38.594 Dean:    and report the two values
2022-03-29 12:10:30.771 Dean:    press that please
2022-03-29 12:10:13.843 Dean:    you can just see it in the gap between the hlep button and the right hand border
2022-03-29 12:09:40.379 Dean:    is a small hidden panel
2022-03-29 12:09:31.602 Dean:    next to the HELP button on the right

2022-03-29 11:52:40.387 Dean:    that I can then use to rectify that gap
2022-03-29 11:52:31.219 Dean:    I will add some code that returns a value for certain items
2022-03-29 11:52:14.970 Dean:    right
2022-03-29 11:52:13.354 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:42:18.531 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:42:14.829 Dean:    so I need an external DVD drive for those bits of software that require physical medium (DRM with physical drive checks)
2022-03-29 11:40:56.743 Dean:    replacing them with 1/2TB HDs
2022-03-29 11:40:45.918 Dean:    I have removed all my internal DVD/CDs from the various laptops
2022-03-29 11:40:24.595 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:40:22.023 Dean:    to allow me to do this
2022-03-29 11:40:11.303 Dean:    so I have a external CD drive coming
2022-03-29 11:39:59.375 Dean:    I still prefer installing from CD
2022-03-29 11:39:42.647 Dean:    but I will soon
2022-03-29 11:39:37.798 Dean:    not yet
2022-03-29 11:39:28.471 Dean:    my newer laptop does not have these .NET versions installed
2022-03-29 11:38:46.321 Dean:    
2022-03-29 11:38:42.645 Dean:    as that was too much work for little old me
2022-03-29 11:38:29.048 Dean:    then stopped keeping it up to date with the VB6 version
2022-03-29 11:38:14.146 Dean:    and then stopped development when I managed to get it to a point where it worked
2022-03-29 11:37:48.643 Dean:    I built that on my old laptop
2022-03-29 11:37:29.850 Dean:    and which I used to build the .NET version of  the Rocketdock enhanced icon editor utility
2022-03-29 11:36:54.524 Dean:    those are the early .NET versions that have a built-in migrator (rubbish but useful) from VB6
2022-03-29 11:36:15.589 Dean:    just installed vb 2008 and 2010 on my desktop
2022-03-29 10:18:23.202 Dean:    I have  some thoughts
2022-03-29 10:18:16.898 Dean:    if not ( I suspect it is still there) then we will do some research on why it is there
2022-03-29 10:17:54.154 Dean:    when you try it on your DEll see if ithas resolved the 'gap' issue on the right hand side of the screen
2022-03-29 10:17:01.826 Dean:    but plenty resolved too
2022-03-29 10:16:50.378 Dean:    plenty of bugs and unknown issues
2022-03-29 10:16:34.994 Dean:    ver 2018
2022-03-29 10:16:20.695 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2022-03-29 10:15:56.099 Dean:    I will address this at the very end
2022-03-29 10:15:34.546 Dean:    yes the 96dpi is common
2022-03-29 09:23:58.994 Dean:    though I havce some code to do the former
2022-03-29 09:23:28.963 Dean:    It will have to wait until the end
2022-03-29 09:23:20.007 Dean:    
2022-03-29 09:23:09.810 Dean:    have alternative versions of the imagery for each level of DPI increase
2022-03-29 09:22:43.578 Dean:    or
2022-03-29 09:22:40.826 Dean:    losing some of the imagery clarity
2022-03-29 09:22:23.482 Dean:    when the DPI setting is changed I need to reload all the imagery associated with the UI and resize dynamically
2022-03-29 09:21:51.538 Dean:    It is a right pain
2022-03-29 09:17:37.115 Dean:    seeing what I need to do to scale the imagery
2022-03-29 09:17:18.244 Dean:    testing FCW with high DPI screens

2022-03-28 18:30:11.302 Dean:    
2022-03-28 18:30:08.782 Dean:    hmmmm
2022-03-28 18:19:30.925 Dean:    Xwidgets would have been a close runner if it had matured
2022-03-28 18:19:07.310 Dean:    and still nothing as good to replace it
2022-03-28 17:44:25.174 Dean:    that was 2014
2022-03-28 17:44:19.118 Dean:    still good after all this time

2022-03-28 14:06:11.773 Dean:    Beedell
2022-03-28 13:58:31.717 Dean:    to fox the nasty NAzis in case they broadcast their own news with their own broadcasters
2022-03-28 13:58:06.652 Dean:    The first chap to say his name and who was reading the news
2022-03-28 13:57:43.397 Dean:    He did all the news reading during the 1940s
2022-03-28 13:57:10.501 Dean:    Who spoke very much in that fashion
2022-03-28 13:56:55.237 Dean:    Trying to sound like Alvar Liddel
2022-03-28 13:55:15.869 Dean:     Windspeed is 2 knots, force 1, direction N

2022-03-28 13:51:15.214 Dean:    but I could hear the main speech, spoken quickly
2022-03-28 13:50:52.252 Dean:    the third has some muted sound at the end
2022-03-28 13:50:00.524 Dean:    Windows did not like the first of those three
2022-03-28 13:49:50.172 Dean:    hmm
2022-03-28 13:44:14.256 Dean:    they aren't real buttons in the VB6 sense but are just images.
2022-03-28 13:43:42.109 Dean:    also, gave the three top main buttons some 'life', they move when depressed and released
2022-03-28 13:42:52.451 Dean:    Coding - polished the themeing and the abaility to switch from dark to high contrast, save the setting and have it re-enabled on next run

2022-03-28 13:15:54.844 Dean:    you can hear it on all the 's'
2022-03-28 13:15:43.421 Dean:    She has a lisp
2022-03-28 11:19:44.427 Dean:    as in Ye Olde Englifhe?
2022-03-28 11:19:24.795 Dean:    Fummer?
2022-03-28 11:19:19.122 Dean:    how does it sound?
2022-03-28 09:41:08.165 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-03-27 22:20:49.643 Dean:    very good

2022-03-27 18:25:17.483 Dean:    could do with the pips there
2022-03-27 18:25:02.763 Dean:    slighgtly better?
2022-03-27 18:21:33.123 Dean:    but it does the job
2022-03-27 18:21:21.818 Dean:    yes, rather
2022-03-27 18:09:12.867 Dean:    but Lucy has resisted it and is tested twice per week
2022-03-27 18:08:52.562 Dean:    well,  Red had it two weeks ago
2022-03-27 18:07:45.323 Dean:    she has slept all day
2022-03-27 18:07:40.311 Dean:    but suppressing it does not help you get over it
2022-03-27 18:07:28.787 Dean:    she has been working through it
2022-03-27 18:07:19.733 Dean:    suffering under this cough
2022-03-27 18:07:12.545 Dean:    Lucy is unwell
2022-03-27 18:07:04.943 Dean:    same here but with chilli con carne
2022-03-27 18:04:21.714 Dean:    that's very good and very true.
2022-03-27 14:17:28.265 Dean:    looks good
2022-03-27 12:57:58.425 Dean:    what are they doing to it?

2022-03-26 14:29:49.925 Dean:    I like that
2022-03-26 14:29:44.109 Dean:    Yes, of course.
2022-03-26 14:20:48.973 Dean:    though I am set up for the next stage
2022-03-26 14:19:25.237 Dean:    no coding at the moment
2022-03-26 14:19:02.261 Dean:    and will last anothe 100 years now
2022-03-26 14:18:52.540 Dean:    probably edwardian
2022-03-26 14:18:26.095 Dean:    I am now doing the same to an old mult-prong fork that weuse for shifting garden cuttings &c
2022-03-26 14:17:43.949 Dean:    I have fixed my old 1942 army shovel, old handle dowelled onto the new shaft so I can say it is the same old shovel just with a new shaft, &c, &c
2022-03-26 14:16:44.669 Dean:    mum being cared for
2022-03-26 14:16:34.070 Dean:    washing machine washing, wash after wash, line full
2022-03-26 14:16:10.956 Dean:    allgoing normally, if not particularly well!
2022-03-26 14:15:54.572 Dean:    lovely here
2022-03-26 14:15:38.706 Dean:    agreed
2022-03-25 23:27:23.826 Dean:    Up the hill to Bedfordshire
2022-03-25 23:27:19.797 Dean:    Bed is calling....off I go.
2022-03-25 23:27:12.466 Dean:    trying to cure a bad cough that we all have here at the moment
2022-03-25 23:26:53.961 Dean:    no alcohol
2022-03-25 23:26:45.458 Dean:    just been to a party
2022-03-25 19:06:01.600 Dean:    Just going out for a while, back later!
2022-03-25 16:11:19.594 Dean:    jealous of their skill
2022-03-25 16:06:29.888 Dean:    I have yet so much to learn
2022-03-25 15:58:09.399 Dean:    I like to visit a good workshop
2022-03-25 15:48:07.655 Dean:     A good powerful 240v motor is a thing to own...
2022-03-25 15:47:25.960 Dean:    my lathe is powered by an old washing machine motor of probably 50s vintage
2022-03-25 15:47:04.535 Dean:    When I do dispose of a wash. m/c then I often keep the motors as I just can't throw them away
2022-03-25 15:46:36.206 Dean:    agreed
2022-03-25 14:30:51.664 Dean:    two solenoid-operated input valves normally cost £12 a pair but it you seal them in a plastci box and encase the water hose in a corrugated outer hose you can charge £200 for the same thing
2022-03-25 14:29:28.319 Dean:    the Siemens/Miele are over- complex and the parts are exorbitant and sometimes encased in boxes so they can charge more
2022-03-25 14:28:40.471 Dean:    especaillyt the cheaper varieties of white good
2022-03-25 14:28:27.588 Dean:    and these days a lot of the bits are modular
2022-03-25 14:28:05.759 Dean:    so I have no fear of motors and electrics (except for capacitors and stupidity on my part)
2022-03-25 14:27:36.439 Dean:    then Hornby trains
2022-03-25 14:27:29.836 Dean:    I started by fixing Scalectrix cars, motors, brushes, pick ups &c
2022-03-25 12:21:10.656 Dean:    what would you have done?
2022-03-25 12:21:02.200 Dean:    but it needed to be done
2022-03-25 12:20:53.736 Dean:    overkill I suppose
2022-03-25 12:20:48.920 Dean:    
2022-03-25 12:20:48.712 Dean:    
2022-03-25 12:20:46.878 Dean:    looks like new
2022-03-25 12:20:39.049 Dean:    and I de-rusted every bit of surface rust I could find in the process
2022-03-25 12:20:17.632 Dean:    certainly more than the machine is worth
2022-03-25 12:19:56.224 Dean:    If the repairman had been called it would have costdouble for the parts (at least) then £35 per hour plus call out
2022-03-25 12:18:48.008 Dean:    so,onto the next machine and victory!
2022-03-25 12:18:33.569 Dean:    as the amount od washing is so great
2022-03-25 12:18:25.112 Dean:    I have to have two machines I realise
2022-03-25 12:18:11.776 Dean:    now the MAIN!

2022-03-25 12:16:56.372 Dean:    I could have dismantled and cleaned and replaced (in fact I did that afterwards) but at £20 a rreplacement was too cheap to avoid doing
2022-03-25 12:16:23.680 Dean:    I also installed a new main PCB £20 as the old rotary switches were failing to make contact
2022-03-25 12:15:58.024 Dean:    just to keep the machine washing!
2022-03-25 12:15:44.188 Dean:    I fitted the new brushes that arrived by post, the previous were those that I knocked up myself from parts of various wash m/cs

2022-03-17 16:28:04.882 Dean:    
2022-03-17 16:28:03.290 Dean:    it is an unnecessary belt and braces anyway
2022-03-17 16:27:43.667 Dean:    removing Do Events fixed it
2022-03-17 16:27:34.801 Dean:    and int he combined window it failed altogether
2022-03-17 16:27:21.601 Dean:    but when it overlapped the bottom window it did not
2022-03-17 16:27:11.210 Dean:    when the upper menu was overlapping the bottom split window it worked
2022-03-17 16:26:39.602 Dean:    a strange bug with DoEvents that is meant to clear the current outstanding event list but it is affected by the mouse position and which control has focus
2022-03-17 16:25:52.153 Dean:    fixed copy and quote menu option in the combined text window
2022-03-17 16:25:30.449 Dean:    FCW - some small coding
2022-03-17 12:35:38.204 Dean:    if you have taken Latin as a subject it is SO true
2022-03-17 12:35:17.001 Dean:    still my favourite scene from that film
2022-03-17 11:25:50.184 Dean:    will fix

2022-03-17 11:21:21.047 Dean:    [quote] I get these from time to time - are they of interest? [/quote] 
2022-03-17 11:21:08.208 Dean:    
2022-03-17 11:21:06.600 Dean:    for example
2022-03-17 11:21:03.001 Dean:    so, I could have an evening with Lucy
2022-03-17 11:20:52.288 Dean:    so that you can hire someone to care for your dependant and then go out
2022-03-17 11:20:20.433 Dean:    I have been told there is a respite group that can provide up to £500 for respite care
2022-03-17 11:19:49.096 Dean:    agreed
2022-03-17 11:19:45.329 Dean:    hmmm
2022-03-17 11:19:39.935 Dean:    [quote] I've had similar contacts, but not at all clear what they can usefully do to help. [/quote] 
2022-03-17 11:17:57.362 Dean:    Morning!
2022-03-16 13:43:05.801 Dean:    seeing what they can do to help

2022-03-15 09:10:09.008 Dean:    Morning!
2022-03-14 23:58:19.018 Dean:    Night Night!
2022-03-14 22:49:40.571 Dean:    dismounting and possibly dismantling the old battery tomorrow
2022-03-14 22:49:19.440 Dean:    all my 18650s are now tested
2022-03-14 22:49:06.015 Dean:    
2022-03-14 22:48:58.636 Dean:    We now have to open it, drill it, solder a cable to the connectors , remove the reamaining prongs, add strain relief
2022-03-14 22:48:06.204 Dean:    I go for solid metal prongs  where possible, v. old style
2022-03-14 22:47:40.755 Dean:    I told him that I always replace such devices with proper plugs that can be earthed
2022-03-14 22:47:05.795 Dean:    the prong broke
2022-03-14 22:47:00.864 Dean:    my boy paid for an expensive PSU to provide power to USB 3 units (he never takes nor asks for my advice) and he bought a unit whose plug had no earth and just a plastic  top prong
2022-03-14 22:45:37.595 Dean:    if I can't find one here will order one
2022-03-14 18:54:47.373 Dean:    see if I have one in my stock
2022-03-14 18:54:35.906 Dean:    I need to obtain one of the two pin connectors
2022-03-14 18:54:15.603 Dean:    I have plenty going spare
2022-03-14 17:45:28.250 Dean:    does the spec sheet state what is required? 5-12v DC specified on the board
2022-03-14 17:44:54.516 Dean:    to power the things
2022-03-14 17:44:44.931 Dean:    I think we might need a PSU next
2022-03-14 17:44:32.555 Dean:    we have proven that
2022-03-14 17:44:22.931 Dean:    your brain is superior to mine
2022-03-14 17:44:09.803 Dean:    that's absolutely true
2022-03-14 16:07:15.306 Dean:    If I manage to obtain more in quantity then I may invest in a device that can do multipel items simultaneously
2022-03-14 15:42:55.651 Dean:    only two more 18650s to test
