2021-11-29 11:37:59.110 Dean:    so it has to be expected
2021-11-29 11:37:28.140 Dean:    there will always be other priorities and they will be forgotten
2021-11-29 11:37:13.410 Dean:    
2021-11-29 11:36:29.880 Dean:    that would be my preferred solution
2021-11-29 11:35:57.900 Dean:    and you can be sure the dischard /recharge cycle is occurring as you want it to
2021-11-29 11:35:32.310 Dean:    then they will come on regularly automatically
2021-11-29 11:35:19.900 Dean:    perhaps also a timer on the input power?
2021-11-29 11:34:53.180 Dean:    but it would require some cables, switches and some circuitry
2021-11-29 11:34:31.340 Dean:    discharging
2021-11-29 11:34:27.130 Dean:    meaning that they are regularly in use
2021-11-29 11:34:03.820 Dean:    Those old push buttons that pop put after n seconds
2021-11-29 11:33:43.430 Dean:    y
2021-11-29 11:33:41.270 Dean:    I suppose it might be better to have those lamps working intermittentlt
2021-11-29 11:32:06.540 Dean:    Morning!
2021-11-29 11:32:04.160 Dean:    Hello!
2021-11-29 11:32:01.080 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2021-11-29 11:31:58.540 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2021-11-28 23:00:27.890 Dean:    but they don't light the area that much
2021-11-28 23:00:14.440 Dean:    They are quite good at indicating the way
2021-11-28 22:41:46.450 Dean:    but they prove the concept
2021-11-28 22:41:37.290 Dean:    Those garden type lamps are probably not quite sufficient
2021-11-28 18:34:55.090 Dean:    a small solar collector on the window sill topping up a battery
2021-11-28 18:34:19.730 Dean:    how about aome solar powered lamps
2021-11-28 18:34:01.140 Dean:    
2021-11-28 18:33:11.910 Dean:    sounds like a good idea
2021-11-28 15:39:47.120 Dean:    looks lovely
2021-11-28 13:58:28.950 Dean:    how long without power?
2021-11-27 22:30:39.780 Dean:    car batteries I mean
2021-11-27 22:29:40.630 Dean:    batteries are fairly cheap these days
2021-11-27 22:29:22.110 Dean:    if the UPS can cope with that
2021-11-27 22:28:46.300 Dean:    if you can buy a battery that you can add to by adding another 12v battery in parallel
2021-11-27 20:23:18.300 Dean:    I sent a text to your mobile that you can ignore
2021-11-27 20:22:24.980 Dean:    shows how bad the storm has been
2021-11-27 20:22:17.270 Dean:    how uncommon
2021-11-27 20:22:09.660 Dean:    that is a serious electrical outage
2021-11-27 20:21:52.690 Dean:    it isn't often that there is no word whatsoever from Harry
2021-11-27 20:21:32.100 Dean:    I knew something wasn't right
2021-11-27 20:21:13.010 Dean:    bloody hell!
2021-11-27 18:29:54.200 Dean:    I have been out most of the day visiting my brother
2021-11-27 18:28:45.380 Dean:    if there is anything I can do just let me know
2021-11-27 18:28:17.800 Dean:    all well?
2021-11-27 12:38:27.020 Dean:    Morning!
2021-11-27 12:38:25.600 Dean:    Hello!
2021-11-27 12:38:20.480 Dean:    just testing

2021-11-26 13:43:20.430 Dean:    but I may not have applied it universally
2021-11-26 13:43:10.090 Dean:    that I have also applied
2021-11-26 13:43:01.590 Dean:    I have a solution to that
2021-11-26 13:42:57.370 Dean:    I have rounded on occasion
2021-11-26 13:42:51.160 Dean:    I have no doubt it is a rounding issue
2021-11-26 13:42:35.520 Dean:    I will add that to the list and check later

2021-11-26 11:39:28.170 Dean:    it has progressivle become larger and more bloated, more invasive, the GUI is growing

2021-11-26 10:17:43.750 Dean:    happens oo much
2021-11-26 10:17:39.290 Dean:    having a regular wobble
2021-11-26 09:50:49.330 Dean:    Dropbox was utilising all the memory
2021-11-26 09:50:38.560 Dean:    Windows required a reboot

2021-11-25 22:10:26.280 Dean:    I'm off to bed now

2021-11-25 22:07:15.070 Dean:    Are you doing well?

2021-11-25 17:02:00.230 Dean:    boot lamp was on
2021-11-25 17:01:51.440 Dean:    bootlid not shutting
2021-11-25 17:01:43.160 Dean:    he had been driving with a dashboard lamp showing the doors were open
2021-11-25 17:01:14.290 Dean:    and his solution was easy
2021-11-25 17:00:58.420 Dean:    (sorry about typos, typing with fingerless mittens)
2021-11-25 17:00:36.190 Dean:    My Father in law just had the sdame problem
2021-11-25 17:00:24.050 Dean:    
2021-11-25 17:00:23.320 Dean:    and the alarm would continue to operate
2021-11-25 16:59:58.840 Dean:    but that is what theyy used to be called
2021-11-25 16:59:50.860 Dean:    not sure what they call them these days
2021-11-25 16:57:58.800 Dean:    then yo could discarnnect the battery using the discarnnect device
2021-11-25 16:45:23.750 Dean:    one other thing you could do is to ft an alarm on a separate battery 
2021-11-25 16:44:23.940 Dean:    see when the drain load drops
2021-11-25 16:44:08.510 Dean:    ammeter in series, then remove the fuses, one by one
2021-11-25 16:40:36.360 Dean:    see if any carpets are damp
2021-11-25 16:40:24.610 Dean:    water ingress from windscreen?
2021-11-25 16:40:08.960 Dean:    it will be  a short somewhere, or a bulb on (possibly boot light)
2021-11-25 16:39:23.390 Dean:    I think you need to investigate the drain
2021-11-25 16:39:06.430 Dean:    battery drain coupled with Winter temperatures
2021-11-25 15:40:27.370 Dean:    quality is no longer by method but set using slider

2021-11-25 10:28:23.040 Dean:    All well with SWMBO?
2021-11-25 10:28:04.500 Dean:    How are you today?
2021-11-25 10:28:00.960 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2021-11-24 23:02:39.270 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2021-11-24 22:52:36.270 Dean:    very tired
2021-11-24 22:52:30.090 Dean:    off to bed myself
2021-11-24 22:52:10.900 Dean:    simialr to a migration from YWE to XWidgets
2021-11-24 22:51:52.700 Dean:    
2021-11-24 22:51:43.500 Dean:    and adapt
2021-11-24 22:51:30.590 Dean:    and just pull in the RB code as required
2021-11-24 22:51:17.210 Dean:    but each function, routine will be handled on a button by button basis
2021-11-24 22:50:42.310 Dean:    the menus, the creation of the form will be unique to VB6
2021-11-24 22:50:07.770 Dean:    l
2021-11-24 22:50:06.120 Dean:    though they are likey to be very similar as they are both BASIC
2021-11-24 22:49:46.130 Dean:    the difference is in the way functions will be triggerred and the drawing routines
2021-11-24 22:48:59.070 Dean:    all the math &c migh have a few minor name changes to some of the functions but that's it
2021-11-24 22:48:38.860 Dean:    The BASIC is more or less identical with VB6
2021-11-24 22:48:26.680 Dean:    
2021-11-24 17:25:19.960 Dean:    stressful times
2021-11-24 17:25:07.930 Dean:    all well?
2021-11-24 17:25:00.220 Dean:    How is she?
2021-11-24 17:24:57.450 Dean:    
2021-11-24 14:29:39.200 Dean:    I do the same for my Mum
2021-11-24 14:29:24.090 Dean:    you can do nothig but watch her just as you are doing
2021-11-24 13:47:47.050 Dean:    schedule home calls re: my mum and myself
2021-11-24 13:47:35.960 Dean:    I have been on the phone this am with the NHS
2021-11-24 13:47:21.890 Dean:    Never be afraid to call an ambulance
2021-11-24 13:47:04.390 Dean:    Did you go to A&E by car or did you call someone to collect you?
2021-11-24 13:46:34.200 Dean:    I am so sorry to hear, you must have been worried
2021-11-24 13:46:11.410 Dean:    so lots potentially to go wrong
2021-11-24 13:46:02.290 Dean:    and he also had a new valve, lots of medications &c
2021-11-24 13:45:43.290 Dean:    My Dad had a mini stroke or two tht made him dodgy on his feet and then confused for a while
2021-11-24 13:45:01.140 Dean:    oxygen levels &c
2021-11-24 13:44:53.970 Dean:    they probably tested all that this morning
2021-11-24 13:44:41.410 Dean:    no underlying heart issue?
2021-11-24 13:44:29.500 Dean:    like
2021-11-24 13:44:27.610 Dean:    Something liek a faint?
2021-11-24 13:43:39.110 Dean:    Do you know anything about what might have caused it?
2021-11-24 13:43:14.970 Dean:    Crikey!
2021-11-24 12:23:16.340 Dean:    first time operation
2021-11-24 12:23:11.620 Dean:    FCW small changes to cope with systems where dropbox is not running and with no audio
2021-11-24 12:22:25.380 Dean:    first time with Amazon firestick?
2021-11-24 12:21:50.950 Dean:    dull and overcast
2021-11-24 09:08:13.740 Dean:    Morning!
2021-11-24 09:08:12.760 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2021-11-24 09:08:09.710 Dean:    Hello!
2021-11-23 19:17:51.630 Dean:    fires li in the lounge
2021-11-23 19:17:36.140 Dean:    thick and chunky
2021-11-23 19:17:29.390 Dean:    home made chicken soup here
2021-11-23 19:17:06.320 Dean:    swine
2021-11-23 17:53:59.360 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DTmL73th7Y
2021-11-23 17:53:57.070 Dean:    I just received one of these
2021-11-23 16:11:06.510 Dean:    The YWE version is much prettier
2021-11-23 14:34:14.560 Dean:    
2021-11-23 14:34:09.970 Dean:    and that was a fairly simple migration
2021-11-23 14:33:54.190 Dean:    and some of the properties too
2021-11-23 14:33:49.290 Dean:    even though the jscript was similar, all the API callsXwidget had were different
2021-11-23 14:33:06.900 Dean:    when migrating my mediaplayer from Y to Xwidgets
2021-11-23 14:32:48.640 Dean:    
2021-11-23 14:32:40.840 Dean:    being exact is vital to allow a good chance at a migration
2021-11-23 14:32:20.530 Dean:    being similar is just a pain when you have a lot of code
2021-11-23 14:31:57.770 Dean:    except I am hoping for the last two
2021-11-23 14:31:46.850 Dean:    but none really suit
2021-11-23 14:31:39.290 Dean:    so much choice
2021-11-23 14:31:27.910 Dean:    now RADBasic and TwinBasic
2021-11-23 14:31:18.930 Dean:    powerbasic, realbasic, freebasic, VB6, VB.NET
2021-11-23 14:30:43.260 Dean:    otherwise it would have been a chice for me
2021-11-23 14:30:26.800 Dean:    It changed so often and beacme more commercial and less accessible over the years
2021-11-23 14:24:14.000 Dean:    no upgrade
2021-11-23 14:24:10.400 Dean:    and costly too
2021-11-23 14:24:06.830 Dean:    yearly licence
2021-11-23 14:24:02.390 Dean:    all change for RB now
2021-11-23 14:23:53.740 Dean:    sorry about typos
2021-11-23 14:23:47.040 Dean:    If I rememebr the RB compiler wasd availa\ble on MAcs as well
2021-11-23 14:09:08.480 Dean:    That runs on Mac too?
2021-11-23 14:07:01.880 Dean:    very quick top ioperate
2021-11-23 14:06:47.430 Dean:    sned me the source and I might convert that to VB6 one day!
2021-11-23 14:05:59.900 Dean:    nice

2021-11-23 13:19:34.130 Dean:    thankyou
2021-11-23 13:19:30.880 Dean:    all good
2021-11-23 12:19:04.800 Dean:    at your leisure
2021-11-23 12:18:57.940 Dean:    can yo please send me a recording, a file or two, a binary too?
2021-11-23 12:18:24.490 Dean:    
2021-11-23 12:14:11.910 Dean:    that I need to make more persistent
2021-11-23 12:13:08.050 Dean:    it also pops up a warning on a binaryhovering over the image 
2021-11-23 12:12:29.610 Dean:    not yet tested
2021-11-23 12:12:22.350 Dean:    I do not know what Win10 will do if FCW tries to run any other binary
2021-11-23 12:11:49.030 Dean:    I will put a check in to tell it to avoid firecallwin.exe specifically
2021-11-23 12:11:15.410 Dean:    if you open a binary it will warn you
2021-11-23 12:11:03.430 Dean:    not fully tested yet
2021-11-23 12:10:55.090 Dean:    you can now double-click on a file, folder in the listbox and it will open it

2021-11-23 10:57:28.440 Dean:    Are you alright?
2021-11-23 10:57:26.800 Dean:    Are you doing well?
2021-11-23 10:57:25.020 Dean:    Are you alright?
2021-11-23 10:57:21.300 Dean:    How are you this fine morn?
2021-11-22 23:37:34.070 Dean:    Cheerio old chum!
2021-11-22 22:29:09.030 Dean:    feels cold out there tonight
2021-11-22 17:41:13.740 Dean:    How are you today?
2021-11-22 16:26:09.170 Dean:    thinking about more heating over the next few days
2021-11-22 16:25:55.610 Dean:    feels cold here too
2021-11-22 14:01:53.030 Dean:    still testing the keyboard
2021-11-22 14:01:48.070 Dean:    
2021-11-22 14:01:44.320 Dean:    just easier to use
2021-11-22 14:01:26.710 Dean:    but I think I now prefer it in single
2021-11-22 14:01:15.090 Dean:    initially I preferred it in dual mode
2021-11-22 14:00:57.090 Dean:    and it is nice to use it that way
2021-11-22 14:00:46.480 Dean:    but I am getting used to it in single mode as per .js FC
2021-11-22 14:00:23.660 Dean:    previously I had always run it in dual chat box mode
2021-11-22 14:00:09.320 Dean:    I am running FCW in single chat box mode
2021-11-22 13:59:27.870 Dean:    .1643
2021-11-22 13:59:10.640 Dean:    can you please send me a very long line of normal text when you have the time?
2021-11-22 13:58:35.670 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2021-11-22 13:58:02.450 Dean:    including my typos
2021-11-22 13:57:55.390 Dean:    r
2021-11-22 13:57:52.140 Dean:    you might see a few funnies on keyboad input on occasion
2021-11-22 13:57:05.200 Dean:    oops
2021-11-22 13:56:58.430 Dean:    it is one of the f on my features on my list
2021-11-22 13:56:34.890 Dean:    implementing this so that you can click anywhere on a listbox and start typing immediately
2021-11-22 13:55:55.390 Dean:    in progress
2021-11-22 13:55:49.520 Dean:    but anything else should divert to the text box below
2021-11-22 13:55:36.090 Dean:    F1, F3 and F5, up and down keys should all do their thing on the listboxes
2021-11-22 13:55:05.880 Dean:    except for those keypresses that ought to affect the listboxes themselves
2021-11-22 13:54:46.830 Dean:    and focus is set accordingly
2021-11-22 13:54:40.240 Dean:    so that they are automatically redirected to the text box below
2021-11-22 13:54:24.130 Dean:    I am just capturing any keypresses made whilst on the main listboxes

2021-11-22 11:24:13.450 Dean:    
2021-11-22 11:23:34.360 Dean:    no way of placing the msgbox itself above, it has to be thwe whole form
2021-11-22 11:22:57.610 Dean:    
2021-11-22 11:03:36.410 Dean:    otherwise the msgbox is always under the file manager on a small screen
2021-11-22 11:02:59.040 Dean:    the main form is set to non-topmost again
2021-11-22 11:02:41.550 Dean:    then when the drop is complete
2021-11-22 11:02:33.600 Dean:    that brings the msgbox to the front too
2021-11-22 11:02:26.320 Dean:    just before the drag and drop code I bring the main form to the very front
2021-11-22 11:02:01.800 Dean:    It is  bit of a hack

2021-11-22 10:59:17.650 Dean:    so forgive the repeated drops

2021-11-22 10:59:03.800 Dean:    to place a dialog box on top
2021-11-22 10:58:53.130 Dean:    testing drag and drop

2021-11-21 23:55:20.810 Dean:    NightlyByeLode!
2021-11-21 23:55:19.820 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!

2021-11-21 23:55:17.660 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2021-11-21 22:06:00.330 Dean:    need to test that on a system that has none, hard to find
2021-11-21 22:05:44.780 Dean:    FCW small changes, now disables the recording/play functionality when there are no audio devices
2021-11-21 22:05:08.860 Dean:    not good
2021-11-21 22:04:05.110 Dean:    HMMM
2021-11-21 16:06:37.060 Dean:    very respectable desktop
2021-11-21 15:52:13.950 Dean:    <><>FCWDesktop01.png
2021-11-21 15:49:51.170 Dean:    you may have noticed I have become a little more verbose recently
2021-11-21 15:49:34.820 Dean:    
2021-11-21 15:49:31.980 Dean:    it is easier than using the laptop keyboard though
2021-11-21 15:49:22.680 Dean:    
2021-11-21 15:49:17.210 Dean:    I will persist with iot for while longer, swap out to the other and compare
2021-11-21 15:48:58.350 Dean:    and it is a usable (spare) keyboard
2021-11-21 15:48:33.110 Dean:    it has been a useful trial though
2021-11-21 15:48:14.750 Dean:    so I am going to try the PC version and see how I get on with it
2021-11-21 15:47:59.460 Dean:    and they don't do what I expect
2021-11-21 15:47:53.020 Dean:    they aren't marked
2021-11-21 15:47:45.290 Dean:    and the keypad home/end seem to be not working
2021-11-21 15:47:28.430 Dean:    the keypresses are quite positive and a little too hard for my liking
2021-11-21 15:47:09.770 Dean:    so it does not take up too much space
2021-11-21 15:47:01.870 Dean:    also slim in format
2021-11-21 15:46:55.480 Dean:    I am going to swap out the Mac keyboard with a more conventional PC one
2021-11-21 15:46:31.310 Dean:    
2021-11-21 15:46:30.970 Dean:    
2021-11-21 15:46:29.230 Dean:    .js on the desktop would have been another defacto standard tool
2021-11-21 15:46:08.480 Dean:    if that had been done
2021-11-21 15:45:55.290 Dean:    the only failure(s4) was not giving it an IDE and failing to get the Linix version ready at the same time
2021-11-21 15:45:08.340 Dean:    I am still taken by YWE, it is such an elegant and polished tool
2021-11-21 15:43:38.740 Dean:    so itis all do-able
2021-11-21 15:33:26.270 Dean:    or use  a KVM switch?
2021-11-21 15:33:11.690 Dean:    so what will you do witht he MAc mini? Set up another screen?
2021-11-21 15:32:51.640 Dean:    
2021-11-21 15:32:49.750 Dean:    and with some fettling...
2021-11-21 15:32:42.520 Dean:    but the case is a corker
2021-11-21 15:32:28.990 Dean:    but the cpus/os are more or less useless to me
2021-11-21 15:32:14.190 Dean:    not sure what I will do with it yet
2021-11-21 15:32:06.170 Dean:

2021-11-21 15:31:30.340 Dean:    where all the components will line up properly
2021-11-21 15:31:15.970 Dean:    plates
2021-11-21 15:31:15.970 Dean:    there are planty of instructional videos showing different m,ethods and even a company selling laser cut G5 adapter 
2021-11-21 15:30:43.860 Dean:    then see what I can do to mount an ATX mboard
2021-11-21 15:30:22.660 Dean:    and  I will pot a good PSU inside the old case
2021-11-21 15:30:01.710 Dean:    taking out the CPUs and the mboard, PSU and cables
2021-11-21 15:29:42.840 Dean:    I am dismantling my old G5 Mac
2021-11-21 15:29:32.870 Dean:    
2021-11-21 15:29:27.410 Dean:    glad the error 70 has gone now though
2021-11-21 15:29:07.950 Dean:    I will have to test on Win10 to see the results
2021-11-21 15:28:58.380 Dean:    I didn't think it would be...

2021-11-21 15:24:37.590 Dean:    what are your thoughts re: the Mac and YWE?
2021-11-21 15:24:14.570 Dean:    
2021-11-21 15:24:13.380 Dean:    at your leisure
2021-11-21 15:23:59.450 Dean:    and see if the right hand border max width is affected
2021-11-21 15:23:44.240 Dean:    please see if that runs first time without the error 70
2021-11-21 15:23:22.170 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2021-11-21 15:21:29.790 Dean:    then they are cheap as chips and designed for the job
2021-11-21 15:21:16.480 Dean:    if  I can drive the LED bub with a standard LED driver
2021-11-21 15:20:54.860 Dean:    I will test and try different options
2021-11-21 15:20:40.070 Dean:    but they seem to be overkill for the simple requirement
2021-11-21 15:20:27.220 Dean:     of course I have loads
2021-11-21 15:20:21.900 Dean:    I see what you mean
2021-11-21 15:11:58.550 Dean:    so I can see what you mean
2021-11-21 15:11:52.750 Dean:    send me a link please for that 12v 2a lamp recommendation
2021-11-21 15:11:07.540 Dean:    so if I can get them all off my back then it is probably a good idea
2021-11-21 15:10:51.520 Dean:    but other AV tools would probably do the same
2021-11-21 15:10:40.440 Dean:    just AVast being picky
2021-11-21 15:10:33.030 Dean:    it isn't really a bug at all
2021-11-21 15:10:25.480 Dean:    which causes a problem for AVast
2021-11-21 15:10:14.420 Dean:    rather than using the shell object
2021-11-21 15:10:06.650 Dean:    I am now using an API to obtain the appdata folder for the user
2021-11-21 15:09:43.650 Dean:    a little bit of coding
2021-11-21 12:57:10.140 Dean:    no coding today
2021-11-21 12:10:32.050 Dean:    or electrocuting herself
2021-11-21 12:10:24.550 Dean:    to stop mum walking off with it
2021-11-21 12:10:07.520 Dean:    and the lamp will be screwed to cabinet into the base of the lamp from the underside
2021-11-21 12:09:22.690 Dean:    the driver will go inside the cabinet
2021-11-21 12:09:02.710 Dean:    using the same fittings
2021-11-21 12:08:55.480 Dean:    to 12v
2021-11-21 12:08:52.160 Dean:    I want to convert a bedside table lamp in mum's room
2021-11-21 12:08:33.870 Dean:    ordered
2021-11-21 12:08:30.570 Dean:    but I think I have found one
2021-11-21 12:08:22.480 Dean:    not easy to find
2021-11-21 12:08:09.890 Dean:    but I need to find a 12v BA22 LED bulb
2021-11-21 12:07:47.660 Dean:    and then add a 240/12v LED driver
2021-11-21 12:07:09.550 Dean:    I was intending to use a BA22 bus type bulb to plug into an existing lamp fitting 
2021-11-21 12:06:43.580 Dean:    r
2021-11-21 12:06:42.030 Dean:    ighto
2021-11-21 11:45:09.450 Dean:    or do you use something else?
2021-11-21 11:44:16.350 Dean:    the lamps you use are they standard b22 bayonet ?
2021-11-21 11:44:01.210 Dean:    or 24v?
2021-11-21 11:43:53.090 Dean:    12v I presume
2021-11-21 11:43:45.330 Dean:    lighting
2021-11-21 11:43:41.490 Dean:    your boat
2021-11-21 11:43:37.140 Dean:    Hello!

2021-11-20 23:04:46.440 Dean:    
2021-11-20 23:04:44.410 Dean:    slowly
2021-11-20 23:04:42.130 Dean:    slwoly
2021-11-20 23:04:38.720 Dean:    I could also convert FCW to .NET and .NET is becoming platform independent
2021-11-20 23:04:09.830 Dean:    
2021-11-20 23:04:06.660 Dean:    My widgets are staying on my screen
2021-11-20 23:03:27.790 Dean:    still be internet facing with a decent firewall
2021-11-20 23:03:06.380 Dean:    do firecall with very little impact
2021-11-20 23:02:43.880 Dean:    you could use one of those to do the old 32bit work, run widgets
2021-11-20 23:02:03.110 Dean:    Do you have one of those little box iMacs?
2021-11-20 23:01:36.550 Dean:    so, still a lot of work but one day...
2021-11-20 23:01:22.270 Dean:    then of course any program that uses Windows APIs has to be recoded to suit the APIs available on that system
2021-11-20 23:00:53.700 Dean:    then the next step is to make it graphic independent of  Windows
2021-11-20 23:00:27.510 Dean:    but they are working on it
2021-11-20 23:00:17.120 Dean:    no forms handling, just code in console mode
2021-11-20 23:00:00.160 Dean:    version of VB6
2021-11-20 22:59:53.890 Dean:    it has just had its first release of a 64bit capability
2021-11-20 22:59:30.090 Dean:    Well, give it time and TwinBasic will allow VB6 programs to run on other oses
2021-11-20 22:58:54.520 Dean:    that seems a problem
2021-11-20 22:58:50.350 Dean:    so, TTFN to widgets?
2021-11-20 22:58:38.020 Dean:    they just choose not to
2021-11-20 22:58:31.510 Dean:    and today's oses and cpus are entirely capable
2021-11-20 22:58:13.730 Dean:    32/16
2021-11-20 22:58:05.830 Dean:    you should be able to run any program you want
2021-11-20 22:57:53.450 Dean:    what a load of restrictive bollox
2021-11-20 22:57:35.910 Dean:    so, the end is nigh
2021-11-20 22:57:30.580 Dean:    that's a bugger
2021-11-20 22:57:05.890 Dean:    Are you alright?
2021-11-20 21:47:26.520 Dean:    or was it drives not connected or similar?
2021-11-20 21:47:07.440 Dean:    What was the problem? PSU?

2021-11-20 13:36:54.480 Dean:    I will note that right hand edge miscalculation when testing on Win10
2021-11-20 13:35:43.350 Dean:    so thy could not get in nor start their cars
2021-11-20 13:35:27.960 Dean:    and the server went down
2021-11-20 13:35:17.660 Dean:    Did yoiu hear about the Tesla owners shut out of their cars because tghey use the app on their phone to unlock it

2021-11-20 13:34:14.840 Dean:    the silly advert at the end abut turning lights on/off by app really annoyed me though
2021-11-20 13:33:32.470 Dean:    I had a day off today
2021-11-20 13:33:27.900 Dean:    all made by Lucy
2021-11-20 13:33:21.630 Dean:    salmon, asparagus and chineses mixed noodles
2021-11-20 13:33:08.360 Dean:    lunch here was unexpectedly good
2021-11-20 13:32:59.980 Dean:    
2021-11-20 13:32:55.960 Dean:    a good explanation
2021-11-20 13:32:41.280 Dean:    
2021-11-20 13:32:31.720 Dean:    That was an interesting video
2021-11-20 13:19:16.990 Dean:    that feels wrong
2021-11-20 13:19:16.990 Dean:    watched it for 20 secs and my answer would be that the electricity would be that the electricity would be instant but 
2021-11-20 13:17:07.990 Dean:    that is a terribly naughty story

2021-11-19 15:45:32.090 Dean:    and the keys are where you expect them!
2021-11-19 15:45:22.850 Dean:    the new keyboard is easier to use
2021-11-19 15:45:10.120 Dean:    searching for keys
2021-11-19 15:45:00.990 Dean:    it can drive you potty
2021-11-19 15:44:47.390 Dean:    
2021-11-19 15:41:54.610 Dean:    I will have to get used to that
2021-11-19 15:41:45.000 Dean:    unfortunately the enter key is smaller
2021-11-19 15:41:30.350 Dean:    but with the new replacement sanity is restored
2021-11-19 15:40:10.660 Dean:    and it was driving me potty
2021-11-19 15:39:54.980 Dean:    some of the keys were in the wrong place
2021-11-19 15:39:39.690 Dean:    just swapped my keyboard on the laptop itself
2021-11-19 15:39:17.560 Dean:    and see the results
2021-11-19 15:39:08.280 Dean:    will test that
2021-11-19 15:21:38.390 Dean:    they will stick with win7 except for testing
2021-11-19 15:21:25.210 Dean:    My mind is made up with regard to the eventual future for desktops in my possession
2021-11-19 15:20:58.300 Dean:    I do dislike everything in Win10+
2021-11-19 15:20:21.060 Dean:    a LQ mode that I can use
2021-11-19 15:20:03.330 Dean:     I imagine that I will have to remove the LQ mode but if I set the HQ recording params I may get 
2021-11-19 13:42:32.590 Dean:    and the error will go
2021-11-19 13:42:26.700 Dean:    AVast will still quarantine a first run but not specifically for that
2021-11-19 13:42:07.910 Dean:    then no need to exclude from Avast just to suppress that error
2021-11-19 13:41:40.530 Dean:    as I have an API that should be able to retrun me the same value without calling the shell object
2021-11-19 13:41:16.430 Dean:    I will deal with that windows error 70 during SpecialFolder 
2021-11-19 13:39:39.100 Dean:    and I will probably remove the old low quality recording altogether if Cortana has hijacked the device
2021-11-19 13:39:11.460 Dean:    the Win10 stuff has to wait
2021-11-19 13:38:58.360 Dean:    right, I am back to my old priorities after adding new bugs to the list
2021-11-19 13:38:37.080 Dean:    
2021-11-19 13:34:53.930 Dean:    you may not be able to disable C ortana as they have disabled that ability

2021-11-19 13:06:57.980 Dean:    it seems that the default audio input stream is in conflict with Cortana, who keeps that open all the time
2021-11-19 13:06:22.600 Dean:    with the same resulting file characteristics
2021-11-19 13:06:09.100 Dean:    others have encountered thge same error on Win10
2021-11-19 13:04:16.080 Dean:    you'll have to search the net for that

2021-11-19 12:17:55.980 Dean:    will take note when testing on Win10
2021-11-19 12:17:45.730 Dean:    understood
2021-11-19 12:16:49.790 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2021-11-19 12:16:37.430 Dean:    not much

2021-11-19 12:15:19.060 Dean:    so, some juggling required
2021-11-19 12:15:02.080 Dean:    not easy to run that only when a certain pref was set as that calls the prefs to load prematurely...
2021-11-19 12:13:43.170 Dean:    so I hav a hidden combobox on the main form that I load then keep that in suynch witht he prefs combobox
2021-11-19 12:13:07.490 Dean:    it is important that the prefs is ony referenced when all the groundwork has been done
2021-11-19 12:12:35.300 Dean:    been executed
2021-11-19 12:12:35.300 Dean:    and so to get the device from the prefs caused abnormal startup of the prefs as tasks to load the controls have not yet 
2021-11-19 12:11:51.150 Dean:    in VB6 if you access a construct in another form it loads the whole form
2021-11-19 12:11:34.210 Dean:    but the combobox that stores the prefs is in the prefs form
2021-11-19 12:11:17.660 Dean:    I enumerate the devices on startup so that they will be ready when the buttons are pressed
2021-11-19 12:10:53.220 Dean:    or difficult in a differnt way
2021-11-19 12:10:38.600 Dean:    that was all more difficult than expected
2021-11-19 12:10:30.220 Dean:    
2021-11-19 12:10:16.140 Dean:    or obtained some during conversion from mp3 to wav
2021-11-19 12:10:00.820 Dean:    but ti may have been recorded with slight hiss
2021-11-19 12:09:49.320 Dean:    and it is easier to replace it with an 'empty' sound
2021-11-19 12:09:26.750 Dean:    sometimes it is difficult to stop a sound playing
2021-11-19 12:09:12.130 Dean:    it could have been the source of the 4 sec hiss when recording
2021-11-19 12:08:56.490 Dean:    it is now shorter
2021-11-19 12:08:50.340 Dean:    it was a few secs long
2021-11-19 12:08:34.160 Dean:    it is an empty  file I play to clear the sound buffer of any currently playing sound
2021-11-19 12:08:09.090 Dean:    drop that file in the resources/sounds
2021-11-19 12:07:56.790 Dean:    <><>nothing.wav
2021-11-19 12:07:25.620 Dean:    
2021-11-19 12:07:22.960 Dean:    hence reduce the size
2021-11-19 12:07:22.960 Dean:    I could add modifications to the sample rate with the new method and then see if I can reduce the quality that way and 
2021-11-19 12:05:54.030 Dean:    We could now do karaoke as well as poetry
2021-11-19 12:05:32.180 Dean:    Something to test there then
2021-11-19 12:05:20.500 Dean:    Ah.
2021-11-19 11:16:54.410 Dean:    a bug fix there required
2021-11-19 11:16:15.890 Dean:    for the low qual option you do not get the choice
2021-11-19 11:16:01.460 Dean:    input selection for low quality recording
2021-11-19 11:16:01.460 Dean:    What might be happening is that my enumeration and selectionof an input method might be interfering with the default

2021-11-19 10:44:18.320 Dean:    I might add an if then around that code to ensure that it is only run on startup if the high quality options are chosen
2021-11-19 10:43:42.270 Dean:    and that is the only new thing that occurs with the new high quality option that could affect the low quality version
2021-11-19 10:42:41.300 Dean:    I do enumerate the audio input devices on form load
2021-11-19 10:41:52.680 Dean:    at some point I will test on Win10

2021-11-19 10:28:54.790 Dean:    the low quality recording did used to run on Win 10?

2021-11-18 14:06:53.740 Dean:    poss a bug or two
2021-11-18 13:53:36.060 Dean:    but it should suffice to test
2021-11-18 13:53:27.640 Dean:    it does not save the two new options in prefs under the sounds tab

2021-11-17 09:25:18.860 Dean:    Weather any good today?
2021-11-17 09:25:16.560 Dean:    How are the family doing?

2021-11-16 21:57:30.040 Dean:    and works on Win10+
2021-11-16 21:56:47.440 Dean:    it will be a real boon if it records with that quality
2021-11-16 21:56:20.810 Dean:    working on converting it
2021-11-16 20:17:16.880 Dean:    so it is a go-er again
2021-11-16 20:17:02.810 Dean:    and the two should be hackable to save that quality recording
2021-11-16 20:16:38.450 Dean:    I have some code to allow saving to a wav file from a memory stream
2021-11-16 17:21:53.770 Dean:    he type that takes serious brainwork
2021-11-16 17:21:26.200 Dean:    to do that sort of investigation
2021-11-16 17:21:17.520 Dean:    but no time available at present
2021-11-16 17:21:06.790 Dean:    
2021-11-16 17:21:03.420 Dean:    perhaps when I have time to disassemble the code and see what it does and how it does it
2021-11-16 17:20:35.860 Dean:    so, that avenue is closed for the moment
2021-11-16 17:20:21.500 Dean:    and I have no idea on either
2021-11-16 17:20:08.680 Dean:    I would have to write something that exists as a memory stream to a wav file
2021-11-16 17:19:45.900 Dean:    I think that modifiying that code is beyond my capabilities at the moment

2021-11-16 16:37:04.450 Dean:    will test
2021-11-16 16:36:56.450 Dean:    a windows 10 peculiarity no doubt
2021-11-16 16:36:39.750 Dean:    strange

2021-11-16 16:20:15.200 Dean:    and I do need to know how to save before I implement it
2021-11-16 16:19:55.470 Dean:    so, it will not be immediate
2021-11-16 16:19:46.060 Dean:    and it is complex
2021-11-16 16:19:40.900 Dean:    it is a lot of code
2021-11-16 16:19:37.170 Dean:    
2021-11-16 16:19:34.100 Dean:    but it shows what can be done
2021-11-16 16:19:25.230 Dean:    it has no abaility to save to a wavfile
2021-11-16 16:19:12.390 Dean:    it records into memory and plays from there
2021-11-16 16:19:00.810 Dean:    I currently do not know how to save a file using that program I sent you
2021-11-16 16:18:45.830 Dean:    
2021-11-16 16:18:44.110 Dean:    I will test on other Windows systems but I suspect it will be the same
2021-11-16 16:18:28.250 Dean:    why that nosie would be there
2021-11-16 16:18:19.280 Dean:    I can't think of any other reason
2021-11-16 16:18:06.010 Dean:    I think the noise in the recording is due to recording through all microphones?

2021-11-16 16:12:39.760 Dean:    the executable file type is quite long
2021-11-16 16:12:19.430 Dean:    if you double click on the image and it is an executable then it will warn you before automatically running it
2021-11-16 16:11:38.450 Dean:    new version with very few changes

2021-11-16 15:03:03.440 Dean:    but the quality will be the same or similar to that of Audacity
2021-11-16 15:02:41.070 Dean:    that will be quite a job to incorporate
2021-11-16 15:02:29.000 Dean:    
2021-11-16 15:02:27.070 Dean:    and record using a different method
2021-11-16 15:02:18.530 Dean:    I have some code that will allow me to select the input device
2021-11-16 15:02:01.770 Dean:    From now on, that is the low quality option!
2021-11-16 15:01:49.700 Dean:    
2021-11-16 15:01:48.960 Dean:    
2021-11-16 15:01:47.420 Dean:    it should all work as per audacity
2021-11-16 15:01:40.640 Dean:    and send the correct params
2021-11-16 15:01:32.610 Dean:    it provides the MCISendString method to talk to the audio devices
2021-11-16 15:01:07.720 Dean:    I think it is simply Windows being annoying
2021-11-16 15:00:49.530 Dean:    which is good quality
2021-11-16 15:00:44.380 Dean:    it is using my default mic

2021-11-16 13:17:04.610 Dean:    There is probably a sound library somewhere that has done all the work for me

2021-11-16 12:51:35.720 Dean:    that investigation was a bit of a waste of time
2021-11-16 12:51:18.190 Dean:    so, I don't bother and hand it all over to the external app just as before
2021-11-16 12:50:57.070 Dean:    and I cannot turn off the play lamp at the correct time
2021-11-16 12:50:41.600 Dean:    but without a track length I cannot set the timer and the slider position
2021-11-16 12:50:13.020 Dean:    and just use the internal method to play 
2021-11-16 12:49:46.630 Dean:    completion time
2021-11-16 12:49:46.630 Dean:    I had wanted to play an external Wav file using the buttons on the sound panel and have the thermometer slider show the 
2021-11-16 12:49:01.780 Dean:    
2021-11-16 12:48:58.740 Dean:    yes, same here on the external app
2021-11-16 12:41:42.770 Dean:    too much effort
2021-11-16 12:41:37.420 Dean:    but I don't want to do that
2021-11-16 12:41:26.790 Dean:    it is possible to open .mp3 files and extract the tags
2021-11-16 12:41:11.180 Dean:    
2021-11-16 12:41:10.640 Dean:    but at least I tried
2021-11-16 12:41:05.590 Dean:    which is how it was beforehand
2021-11-16 12:40:53.330 Dean:    so, the timer and thermometer scale cannot be made to operate for externally recorded files
2021-11-16 12:40:18.000 Dean:    but no joy
2021-11-16 12:40:14.770 Dean:    one of those properties should have been the length returned in a fixed length string
2021-11-16 12:39:40.090 Dean:    it used the same method I use for recording to open and file and return status
2021-11-16 12:39:06.700 Dean:    many trials
2021-11-16 12:39:02.660 Dean:    the code I had no longer works on Windows
2021-11-16 12:38:48.260 Dean:    they are all recorded using different frequencies and those are unknown if externally recorded
2021-11-16 12:38:19.170 Dean:    I just tried to add code to FCWin to calculate the length of sound files it encouners
2021-11-16 12:37:34.540 Dean:    Never!
2021-11-16 11:32:25.320 Dean:    very little coding yesterday, mum kept me busy

2021-11-15 13:27:54.570 Dean:    when it tries to do a shell object call
2021-11-15 13:27:44.160 Dean:    I think that is caused by your a/v tool initially suspending the firecallWin.exe

2021-11-14 15:53:36.470 Dean:    working on someone else's convoluted, monolthic and undocumented code is never easy
2021-11-14 15:52:55.950 Dean:    spent a day in total trying to make it work on its own and ot was an abject failure
2021-11-14 15:52:27.260 Dean:    very complicated code
2021-11-14 15:52:15.180 Dean:    I found one but it is mixed in with 50 or sixty other controls and is next to impossible to extract
2021-11-14 15:51:48.310 Dean:    and will wait for a response.
2021-11-14 15:51:39.040 Dean:    I have asked on the forum whether anyone has a unicode enabled textbox (I am sure someone MUST have)
2021-11-14 15:51:04.080 Dean:    I will hold off on that one for the moment
2021-11-14 15:50:54.910 Dean:    
2021-11-14 15:50:51.650 Dean:    so, not easy
2021-11-14 15:50:37.930 Dean:    as the standard output via the .text property is ANSI
2021-11-14 15:50:20.330 Dean:    then subclass the control to allow my code to intercept the output and replace that with my own code
2021-11-14 15:49:44.340 Dean:    force it to one line and handle any resulting weird behaviours of a multi-line tool acting as a single line one
2021-11-14 15:48:59.110 Dean:    it seems I might have to replace the standard text box with a rich text box that handles unicode
2021-11-14 15:48:16.390 Dean:    not succeeding in that attempt
2021-11-14 15:05:44.960 Dean:    in the initial text box
2021-11-14 15:05:38.270 Dean:    I am trying to find a VB6 control that allows input of unicode characters
2021-11-14 15:05:02.700 Dean:    busy here tidying one main room and looking after Mum

2021-11-09 18:15:18.260 Dean:    looks good!
2021-11-09 17:15:34.280 Dean:    always pleased when a repair goes well
2021-11-09 17:15:25.060 Dean:    but a new fan swapped in and it is tested and works!
2021-11-09 17:15:06.880 Dean:    so cheap
2021-11-09 17:15:03.680 Dean:    It was bought on the understanding that the board had failed and it was for parts
2021-11-09 17:14:33.160 Dean:    that has been replaced and it works perfectly
2021-11-09 17:14:18.520 Dean:    it had a bad fan
2021-11-09 17:14:14.830 Dean:    I have upgraded my boy's desktop with an AMD 7850 GPU that I resurrected
2021-11-09 17:13:40.730 Dean:    no issues for a long time here

2021-11-09 14:57:33.050 Dean:    I like the thermometer addition to FC, a small graphical change makes all the difference

2021-11-09 14:56:42.270 Dean:    I am getting used to the new mic

2021-11-09 11:09:36.810 Dean:    all going well
2021-11-09 11:09:29.660 Dean:    doing a few test recordings to test the red line growiing in the x axis
2021-11-09 11:08:45.200 Dean:    testing please ignore

2021-11-09 11:00:19.820 Dean:    I was very surprised that it was SO easy...
2021-11-09 11:00:05.220 Dean:    but I felt I had understood the challenge where no-one else had.
2021-11-09 10:59:45.230 Dean:    I knew it was naughty
2021-11-09 10:59:35.960 Dean:    but at the time I felt no guilt
2021-11-09 10:59:18.990 Dean:    I feel very guilty about it now
2021-11-09 10:59:11.800 Dean:    
2021-11-09 10:58:59.430 Dean:    which was a lot in 1968 
2021-11-09 10:58:44.330 Dean:    I must have had two-three pounds out of that machine
2021-11-09 10:58:20.980 Dean:    as they obviously knew something was wrong
2021-11-09 10:58:03.250 Dean:    and being fixed/overhauled
2021-11-09 10:57:46.490 Dean:    on the final three or so days my visit was disturbed as the machine was out of action
2021-11-09 10:57:12.980 Dean:    ice creams &c
2021-11-09 10:56:58.610 Dean:    and as much licorice as I wanted
2021-11-09 10:56:51.710 Dean:    I bought a clockwork MBT boat
2021-11-09 10:56:25.700 Dean:    and that machine funded my holiday spending
2021-11-09 10:56:12.840 Dean:    to disguise my naughtiness
2021-11-09 10:56:00.560 Dean:    and played it as well as another two machines next door
2021-11-09 10:55:45.670 Dean:    for 10 days I walked in for 40 mins or so
2021-11-09 10:55:23.410 Dean:    and from then on every day I would visit the machine and take it for a ride!
2021-11-09 10:54:55.720 Dean:    this was the late 1960s
2021-11-09 10:54:42.880 Dean:    I betted on a few winners and confirmed my analysis
2021-11-09 10:54:28.430 Dean:    my money almost all spent (you had to spend to stay or they chucked you out!)
2021-11-09 10:54:02.140 Dean:    (the black horse)
2021-11-09 10:53:50.610 Dean:    and hence the time when the high pay out horse would seldomly win
2021-11-09 10:53:08.580 Dean:    eventually found the periodicity
2021-11-09 10:52:56.710 Dean:    I watched the race and secretly noted the outcomes on a notepad whilst spending money on two/three games
2021-11-09 10:52:00.650 Dean:    With a few shillings worth of coins (my whole pocket money)
2021-11-09 10:51:35.770 Dean:    from the noise of the thing
2021-11-09 10:51:28.660 Dean:    but I roughly knew what was going on
2021-11-09 10:51:16.690 Dean:    I must have been sub eight years old
2021-11-09 10:51:04.930 Dean:    probably using cams
2021-11-09 10:51:00.200 Dean:    even then I guessed that it was probably mechanical at its core
2021-11-09 10:50:25.200 Dean:    very complex mechanically
2021-11-09 10:50:09.730 Dean:    there were lots of stations where you placed your pennies to bet on the outcome
2021-11-09 10:49:44.640 Dean:    that ran a race around this long and curvy track
2021-11-09 10:49:31.350 Dean:    with six tracks and coloured horses on slots
2021-11-09 10:49:11.770 Dean:    very large, curvy table type game
2021-11-09 10:48:55.890 Dean:    there was a horse race track game
2021-11-09 10:48:43.460 Dean:    very bored I went to the amusement arcade which was a rather large one with lots of electro mechanical games
2021-11-09 10:48:03.890 Dean:    When I was a little boy I went on holiday to one of those holiday parks with the extended family
2021-11-09 10:40:52.560 Dean:    seen it before

2021-11-08 13:32:40.880 Dean:    rather a to-do just to get a balloon tip
2021-11-08 13:32:25.650 Dean:    a balloon tip to each frame
2021-11-08 13:32:25.650 Dean:    I have to add a new frame for each option button and on each frame are the text labels and I can then successfully add 
2021-11-08 13:31:36.090 Dean:    but text labels don't show balloon tips
2021-11-08 13:31:22.650 Dean:    and added my own text
2021-11-08 13:31:10.860 Dean:    so, I cut the text off and just had the option buttons
2021-11-08 13:30:48.940 Dean:    balloon tips will not show

2021-11-06 11:56:00.000 Dean:    I find it quite endearing
2021-11-06 11:55:52.340 Dean:    he just has the incompetence of humanity in general as a trait
2021-11-06 11:55:00.290 Dean:    I see them as very much a muchness
2021-11-06 11:54:45.770 Dean:    more of an expression of disatisfaction of the rest of the equally awful politicians
2021-11-06 11:54:07.690 Dean:    He was never a politician
2021-11-06 11:32:15.930 Dean:    When they seee they have Boris on the ropes they'll come out en masse
2021-11-06 11:31:40.940 Dean:    I see them

2021-11-05 15:57:21.920 Dean:    
2021-11-05 15:02:10.050 Dean:    just tiny fixes
2021-11-05 15:02:04.820 Dean:    right click actions &c
2021-11-05 15:01:58.990 Dean:    balloon tips corrected here and there
2021-11-05 15:01:43.060 Dean:    FCW, a couple of small fixes
2021-11-05 15:01:29.770 Dean:    
2021-11-05 14:56:52.210 Dean:    I think it was simply a matter of quality
2021-11-05 14:42:03.430 Dean:    but there were six in here, plus a LED strip and a light panel
2021-11-05 14:41:34.270 Dean:    No, they failed, one by one
2021-11-05 13:43:34.680 Dean:    and I will look for some higher quality items later
2021-11-05 13:43:18.040 Dean:    I have bought some similar drivers, again cheap just to get them working again
2021-11-05 13:42:52.750 Dean:    so the electrician put some cheap drivers  in when he installed the LED lamps
2021-11-05 13:42:31.670 Dean:    and all are good
2021-11-05 13:42:23.380 Dean:    tested the lamps in a working driver
2021-11-05 13:42:14.550 Dean:    all the drivers have failed
2021-11-05 13:42:07.020 Dean:    removed the LED lamps from the ceiling x 5

2021-11-03 12:39:02.520 Dean:    I have to test this stuff on Win10 here
2021-11-03 12:35:10.360 Dean:    I put it in the incorrect place
2021-11-03 12:35:03.190 Dean:    oops my code was completely wrong
2021-11-03 12:33:51.050 Dean:    some adaptation required
2021-11-03 12:09:47.890 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2021-11-03 12:09:18.470 Dean:    as that causes identical results, ie. cropping
2021-11-03 12:09:05.050 Dean:    which led me down the garden path
2021-11-03 12:08:59.110 Dean:    and there was a lot of chat about DPI awareness
2021-11-03 12:08:46.730 Dean:    which is suprising
2021-11-03 12:08:39.710 Dean:    and not a lot of information abounds on this usage
2021-11-03 12:08:22.590 Dean:    and scalewidth/height is a misnomer
2021-11-03 12:08:07.470 Dean:    that was not obvious
2021-11-03 12:07:47.910 Dean:    I set the DesiredClientWidth manually
2021-11-03 12:07:35.450 Dean:    Me.Height = Me.Height - Me.ScaleHeight + DesiredClientHeight
2021-11-03 12:07:26.450 Dean:    which is more or less the internal width
2021-11-03 12:06:55.890 Dean:    there is a scalewidth/height
2021-11-03 12:06:39.590 Dean:    so you cannoot use form.width/height to control the size of the form
2021-11-03 12:06:17.080 Dean:    the border thickness is part of that
2021-11-03 12:06:05.710 Dean:    and it changes with each theme you could possibly apply
2021-11-03 12:05:38.270 Dean:    and they can change that (and do!)  at will
2021-11-03 12:05:24.960 Dean:    form.width and height refers to the whole form area including all the MS extra themeing bollox
2021-11-03 12:04:48.480 Dean:    
2021-11-03 12:04:46.490 Dean:    that might fix the right hand size resizing too
2021-11-03 11:18:03.020 Dean:    I will test on Win 10
2021-11-03 11:17:49.790 Dean:    meaning it did not like something FCW wanted to do
2021-11-03 11:17:36.880 Dean:    
2021-11-03 11:17:34.990 Dean:    s
2021-11-03 11:17:33.900 Dean:    the error 70 is a simple file permissions error in window
2021-11-03 11:11:13.700 Dean:    I will add that to the list
2021-11-03 11:11:08.790 Dean:    there is definitely a font selection bug giving italic for some reason
2021-11-03 11:10:50.840 Dean:    
2021-11-03 11:08:38.190 Dean:    if it fixes the bottom then I will apply it to the right hand side too
2021-11-03 11:08:19.960 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2021-11-03 11:07:50.320 Dean:    please test
2021-11-03 11:07:41.820 Dean:    I have a fix to the height and cropping of just the bottom buttons

2021-11-03 10:42:11.220 Dean:    sorry, MS Sans serif
2021-11-03 10:41:45.610 Dean:    at design time it is arial
2021-11-03 10:41:38.020 Dean:    I have always used centurion light SF at 8 pt during usage
2021-11-03 10:39:48.700 Dean:    monies
2021-11-03 10:39:48.700 Dean:    the previous amount that I received 10 years ago was.... £350 after paying her off and all those others who had owed 
2021-11-03 10:38:44.360 Dean:    and it was unexpected
2021-11-03 10:38:33.680 Dean:    it is just my legacy from my Great Uncle in a greatly reduced condition
2021-11-03 10:37:53.860 Dean:    it isn't much money
2021-11-03 10:36:27.220 Dean:    as it is now too long for her to maker a claim on it
2021-11-03 10:36:09.450 Dean:    after 10 years he released the remainder
2021-11-03 10:35:48.880 Dean:    the solicitor made her claim for a specific amount and hid the difference
2021-11-03 10:33:22.150 Dean:    or go to court and fight the order
2021-11-03 10:33:13.910 Dean:    she claims they promised her the home and with the high legal costs you have to buy her claim
2021-11-03 10:32:51.010 Dean:    but it is all perfectly legal....
2021-11-03 10:32:38.350 Dean:    she has done it five times before
2021-11-03 10:32:29.790 Dean:    and she exploits vulnerable old men to get them to hand over their properties
2021-11-03 10:31:58.020 Dean:    she was his CARER!
2021-11-03 10:31:47.590 Dean:    as she says he promised it to her
2021-11-03 10:31:36.020 Dean:    but his carer put an H order to stop any sale
2021-11-03 10:31:16.320 Dean:    it was a house that I was left by my Great Uncle, in Scotland
2021-11-03 10:30:20.230 Dean:    after 10 years that person could no longer make a claim
2021-11-03 10:30:04.720 Dean:    he was hiding the money from a malicious and vindictive creditor
2021-11-03 10:29:25.390 Dean:    The 10 years was deliberate on the part of the solicitor
2021-11-03 10:26:17.340 Dean:    though I may have to add that in future
2021-11-03 10:24:22.320 Dean:    setting a control width and height automatically (they are set and do not auto expand) would be painful to code
2021-11-03 10:23:47.490 Dean:    you have to choose a font size that fits
2021-11-03 10:16:51.480 Dean:    not a huge amount
2021-11-03 10:16:20.430 Dean:    10 years after my Great Uncle's death
2021-11-03 10:15:51.290 Dean:    a little legacy arrived
2021-11-03 10:15:41.770 Dean:    some good news yesterday
2021-11-03 10:15:28.200 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?

2021-11-02 18:40:42.910 Dean:    and everyone there
2021-11-02 18:40:37.730 Dean:    honestly sometimes I want to shoot MS
2021-11-02 18:40:19.740 Dean:    I just have to figure out how
2021-11-02 18:40:11.520 Dean:    I have some scale properties that I can use
2021-11-02 18:39:47.020 Dean:    theme
2021-11-02 18:39:42.500 Dean:    so if I develop on an o/s with a different them I have to take Microsoft's future buggerings about into account
2021-11-02 18:39:07.110 Dean:    height
2021-11-02 18:39:07.110 Dean:    so, if  Windy10 adopts a thick title bar, the form height incorporates that extra space as part of the overall form 
2021-11-02 18:38:12.050 Dean:    various themeing changes applied by the o/s
2021-11-02 18:38:12.050 Dean:    it seems that the form height and width as specified in the designer and as shown on the desktop take into account 
2021-11-02 18:37:23.780 Dean:    I may have a fix for the form cropping
2021-11-02 18:37:14.900 Dean:    
2021-11-02 17:09:50.880 Dean:    at times, I enjoy a ginger cake as much as I do a lemon drizzle
2021-11-02 17:09:33.460 Dean:    tea and ginger cake here
2021-11-02 17:09:19.440 Dean:    useful link
2021-11-02 15:01:28.660 Dean:    basically setting a form width manually on win7 is different on win10
2021-11-02 15:00:43.430 Dean:    but only on Win10
2021-11-02 15:00:31.480 Dean:    it crops
2021-11-02 15:00:28.380 Dean:    when I save the user-defined width and restore it to that value
2021-11-02 14:59:57.080 Dean:    I can do the same for the width but it is the memory of the width height that is causing the problem
2021-11-02 14:58:28.370 Dean:    can you please restart FCW and let me know the new form height it displays
2021-11-02 14:36:37.870 Dean:    I will raise that as part of the query
2021-11-02 14:36:25.700 Dean:    it seems as if Win10 is calculating form height differently perhaps due to the border padding or similar?
2021-11-02 14:35:46.570 Dean:    but not in Win7
2021-11-02 14:35:35.100 Dean:    but the result of that is cropping at runtime
2021-11-02 14:35:07.780 Dean:    setting to a predefined value that matches the same in the designer at design time
2021-11-02 14:34:40.840 Dean:    What I am doing is setting the form height during a resize event
2021-11-02 14:34:18.890 Dean:    hmmm
2021-11-02 14:30:55.590 Dean:    that is after a restart?
2021-11-02 14:27:30.620 Dean:    I will have to learn how to be as tolerant as you
2021-11-02 14:27:17.140 Dean:    or perhaps as you are used to mine
2021-11-02 14:26:58.530 Dean:    I will tolerate typos better than you
2021-11-02 14:26:33.910 Dean:    voice activated coding is what we need!
2021-11-02 14:26:09.050 Dean:    I should imagine it might be the tiller!
2021-11-02 14:25:55.820 Dean:    so take care
2021-11-02 14:25:43.680 Dean:    all the joints were swollen
2021-11-02 14:25:35.190 Dean:    it felt as if I had arthritis in my hands
2021-11-02 14:25:16.340 Dean:    now all gone
2021-11-02 14:25:10.620 Dean:    in my hands, feet and elbows
2021-11-02 14:24:55.290 Dean:    be aware that my covid started as internal joint pains
2021-11-02 14:24:03.060 Dean:    I expect it to still be clipped at the bottom
2021-11-02 14:23:37.640 Dean:    I doubt it
2021-11-02 14:23:34.680 Dean:    see if it maintains the height after a restart on Win 10
2021-11-02 14:23:18.480 Dean:    can you please line it up with the graphics manually and restart
2021-11-02 14:22:52.600 Dean:    new FCW that does not constrain form height
2021-11-02 14:22:37.220 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2021-11-02 14:11:37.900 Dean:    If you need to know which he uses can supply details
2021-11-02 14:11:20.290 Dean:    and it resolves his problem
2021-11-02 14:11:11.720 Dean:    and he has bought a trackball that he is now quite used to
2021-11-02 14:10:56.320 Dean:    my brother has it
2021-11-02 14:10:44.520 Dean:    is that new?
2021-11-02 14:10:35.890 Dean:    When did the carpal tunnel start?
2021-11-02 14:10:11.350 Dean:    looks nice though
2021-11-02 14:09:49.490 Dean:    I just wanted to see howit looked on your system
2021-11-02 14:09:38.890 Dean:    I did not expect it would change the cropping
2021-11-02 14:09:25.560 Dean:    I'll look into that
2021-11-02 14:09:17.810 Dean:    hmmm
2021-11-02 12:39:42.840 Dean:    and then set your FCW chat to the same font?
2021-11-02 12:39:23.960 Dean:    can you please find the linux biolinium font in the FCW folder and double click on it to install?
2021-11-02 12:38:58.720 Dean:    
2021-11-02 11:41:13.980 Dean:    I am going to test the screen resolutions on my other desktops to see what occurs
2021-11-02 11:40:48.080 Dean:    in that regard
2021-11-02 11:40:40.560 Dean:    it might think it is a laptop
2021-11-02 11:40:30.940 Dean:    your all-in-one PC/screen might be different
2021-11-02 11:40:13.020 Dean:    or alt+prntScr
2021-11-02 11:40:05.090 Dean:    on desktops it was tradtionally ctrl+prtScr
2021-11-02 11:39:36.380 Dean:    but I thought it was because I have a laptop
2021-11-02 11:39:21.860 Dean:    on my Dell I actually use Fn+Alt+prtScr
2021-11-02 11:38:53.280 Dean:    it may be a BIOS thing
2021-11-02 11:38:46.700 Dean:    find out what the key sequence is on your Dell
2021-11-02 11:30:11.830 Dean:    clipped wings, cropped supercharger and clapped out airframe (old)
2021-11-02 11:29:43.010 Dean:    that is how they used to describe a Mark of Spitfire during the war
2021-11-02 11:29:19.480 Dean:    clipped, cropped and crapped
2021-11-02 11:27:19.150 Dean:    alt = app only
2021-11-02 11:27:06.140 Dean:    the other just the current running app
2021-11-02 11:26:58.430 Dean:    one does whole desktop
2021-11-02 11:26:47.970 Dean:    ctrl+prtScr
2021-11-02 11:26:41.790 Dean:    alt+prtScr
2021-11-02 11:26:10.550 Dean:    that's fine
2021-11-02 11:15:32.390 Dean:    showing the buttons cut off
2021-11-02 11:15:24.590 Dean:    the Whole FCW window please
2021-11-02 11:12:38.810 Dean:    there's not much they can do about it but they may know a workaround
2021-11-02 11:12:20.120 Dean:    I am raising a bug with the VB forum
2021-11-02 11:12:09.550 Dean:    just in its default state with original sizing
2021-11-02 11:11:52.490 Dean:    Can you please send a  screenshot of FCW in unwidened mode
2021-11-02 11:11:28.730 Dean:    
2021-11-02 11:11:27.250 Dean:    interesting

2021-11-02 10:56:44.040 Dean:    can you try setting UAC to OFF
2021-11-02 10:56:36.000 Dean:    that permission denied is a weird one
2021-11-02 10:54:13.090 Dean:    my max line length is short
2021-11-02 10:54:02.440 Dean:    which is what it was doing
2021-11-02 10:53:32.930 Dean:    at the moment it is better than losing the line
2021-11-02 10:53:09.290 Dean:    and report the results please

2021-11-02 10:32:15.620 Dean:    I have something t think about and research
2021-11-02 10:32:05.100 Dean:    right
2021-11-02 10:31:46.100 Dean:    the resolution in pixels I mean width and height
2021-11-02 10:31:30.570 Dean:    and that is not - normal
2021-11-02 10:31:09.130 Dean:    but we are also seeing the same problem at normal DPIs
2021-11-02 10:30:51.690 Dean:    how to handle high DPIs, and I am looking into that
2021-11-02 10:30:33.570 Dean:    I have two problems
2021-11-02 10:30:11.160 Dean:    what is the resolution please?
2021-11-02 10:30:03.160 Dean:    it is meant to all work at 100%
2021-11-02 10:29:56.420 Dean:    but not at 100%
2021-11-02 10:29:50.930 Dean:    I would expect it to crop at 125%
2021-11-02 10:29:38.320 Dean:    it should be 100%
2021-11-02 10:16:00.350 Dean:    amnd the resolution of the screen again please?
2021-11-02 10:15:28.040 Dean:    cropping is only meant to happen when scaling is > 100% and DPI > 96
2021-11-02 10:14:47.390 Dean:    it is VERY strange
2021-11-02 10:14:38.930 Dean:    that is correct at 100%

2021-11-01 14:58:31.940 Dean:    and when I get a chance on win 10 too
2021-11-01 14:58:22.100 Dean:    I will test the ballons on 64bit and 32bit Win7

2021-11-01 13:44:31.270 Dean:    and see if that changes what you are seeing
2021-11-01 13:44:22.550 Dean:    try turning off the ordinary tooltips
2021-11-01 13:43:39.630 Dean:    as soon as you leave the control it will end
2021-11-01 13:43:25.860 Dean:    it will persist
2021-11-01 13:43:18.970 Dean:    you can see that when you move you raise a ballon tip but rotate your mouse within the boundaries of that control
2021-11-01 13:42:03.630 Dean:    ut the slightest inconsequential mousemove will cause them to persist 
2021-11-01 13:41:39.440 Dean:    and do so for me

2021-11-01 12:49:14.250 Dean:    so it tests that
2021-11-01 12:49:08.850 Dean:    I do not yet have dropbox on it

2021-11-01 12:47:55.660 Dean:    I retreat to it when I want to play a game
2021-11-01 12:47:43.630 Dean:    it is at the top of the house in my bedroom
2021-11-01 12:47:26.650 Dean:    I even have an upgraded CPU for it but the current one is not bad
2021-11-01 12:47:04.560 Dean:    all built using spare parts acquired here and there for next to nothing

2021-11-01 12:46:36.240 Dean:    and a decent GPU and it is truning out to be quite a good machine
2021-11-01 12:46:19.800 Dean:    that I stuck into an old box and PSU
2021-11-01 12:46:00.970 Dean:    I have a powerful old motherboard bought in a lot of other 'broken' or discarded bits
2021-11-01 11:01:34.620 Dean:    I just need to fix it in a way that won't break things
2021-11-01 11:01:19.810 Dean:    so I know where the problem is
2021-11-01 11:01:09.910 Dean:    as there is a limitation on the listboxes
2021-11-01 11:00:43.950 Dean:    and I now need to handle it without making FCW unusable
2021-11-01 11:00:29.660 Dean:    I but it is done that way for a reason
2021-11-01 11:00:15.960 Dean:    yes
2021-11-01 10:56:59.640 Dean:    
2021-11-01 10:56:56.440 Dean:    this way we should be able to reproduce the duplication if it decides to re-appear
2021-11-01 10:56:17.840 Dean:    and respond to each
2021-11-01 10:56:11.900 Dean:    I'll just read them as I arrive back at the laptop
2021-11-01 10:55:45.190 Dean:    it would be appreciated
2021-11-01 10:55:38.270 Dean:    if you can do the same
2021-11-01 10:55:32.700 Dean:    and I will send some messages regularly
2021-11-01 10:55:22.790 Dean:    but I will be here frequently
2021-11-01 10:55:15.850 Dean:    so I may not be on for a large period of time
2021-11-01 10:54:57.160 Dean:    I have a lot to do today
2021-11-01 10:47:47.840 Dean:    so that we can fix that right hand side cut off
2021-11-01 10:47:34.520 Dean:    I want to add that code that determines the DPI of your screen
2021-11-01 10:47:17.330 Dean:    righto
2021-11-01 10:46:39.040 Dean:    it excludes any potential for confusion
2021-11-01 10:46:24.800 Dean:    t
2021-11-01 10:46:22.320 Dean:    I jus think it would be wise to have only one running with access to the same files
2021-11-01 10:44:25.030 Dean:    refreshing first of all
2021-11-01 10:44:17.230 Dean:    and see if it reoccurs
2021-11-01 10:44:12.350 Dean:    and let us try  FCW both on utf8 for a while
2021-11-01 10:43:50.710 Dean:    just to avoid confusion
2021-11-01 10:43:27.020 Dean:    so when FCW is running, FCjs is not
2021-11-01 10:43:15.110 Dean:    can you please ensure that only one client is running at a time
2021-11-01 10:41:28.540 Dean:    then please try utf8
2021-11-01 10:40:00.460 Dean:    just a shot in the dark
2021-11-01 10:39:52.280 Dean:    let's see if that has any effect
2021-11-01 10:39:35.170 Dean:    I have already switched
2021-11-01 10:39:00.880 Dean:    and I suggest we switch from utf8 to ansi for a few days
2021-11-01 10:37:31.560 Dean:    in user appdata/roaming
2021-11-01 10:37:18.820 Dean:    could you send me your settings.ini please?
2021-11-01 10:36:48.860 Dean:    it is most strange to be so inconsistently consistent at this end but not at yours
2021-11-01 10:36:20.730 Dean:    and I've used it daily
2021-11-01 10:36:03.480 Dean:    as it has never happened at this end
2021-11-01 10:35:53.020 Dean:    I am trying to figure out the conditions under which this occurs
2021-11-01 10:35:00.590 Dean:    due to missing lines
2021-11-01 10:34:53.400 Dean:    I was wondering if an earlier edit of the file could affect how it affects the refresh
2021-11-01 10:31:25.310 Dean:    Q. for you had you edited your output field in any way recently?
2021-11-01 10:27:42.260 Dean:    I will add it to the list
2021-11-01 10:27:30.550 Dean:    Well, leave that to me
2021-11-01 10:23:47.840 Dean:    I just need to think about how I avoid it without causing refresh problems
2021-11-01 10:23:31.710 Dean:    because of it is the latter then I know wha the problem is
2021-11-01 10:23:01.020 Dean:    or did you manually add it there to show me?
2021-11-01 10:22:14.680 Dean:    it is there in your file though
2021-11-01 10:18:46.480 Dean:    to test
2021-11-01 10:18:40.750 Dean:    I have a clue as to what to do
2021-11-01 10:18:32.020 Dean:    and I have to figure out why it might on your system
2021-11-01 10:18:17.900 Dean:    It has never happened here
2021-11-01 10:18:03.820 Dean:    I'll have to think about that
2021-11-01 10:17:30.970 Dean:    that is important
2021-11-01 10:17:05.620 Dean:    I see it
2021-11-01 10:15:14.130 Dean:     Pressure: 990 mb

2021-11-01 10:14:45.580 Dean:    feeling better x 5
2021-11-01 10:14:37.610 Dean:    same with my boy
2021-11-01 10:14:33.070 Dean:    I have done a test and no Covid
2021-11-01 10:14:23.750 Dean:    
2021-11-01 10:14:22.040 Dean:    if your mouse is a LED type on a non smooth surface it may be moving minutely
2021-11-01 10:13:32.890 Dean:    7.5 secs
2021-11-01 10:12:56.690 Dean:    mine do!
2021-11-01 10:11:40.660 Dean:    tea and porridge here
2021-11-01 10:11:33.610 Dean:    
2021-11-01 10:11:22.960 Dean:    <p><p> Refresh Interval:60 OS:Windows 7 Professional Version 0.0.1497
2021-11-01 10:11:11.930 Dean:    it helps me to have one that I 'believe' even though belief should have nothing to do with it
2021-11-01 10:10:39.040 Dean:    as it seems more in accordance with a human interpretation of quantum physics
2021-11-01 10:10:14.080 Dean:    so, I have now my preferred theory and that is pilot wave theory
2021-11-01 10:09:47.900 Dean:    even though it does so when reading all about it
2021-11-01 10:09:34.570 Dean:    and my brain refuses to accept it...
2021-11-01 10:09:24.340 Dean:    it has no meaningful application in my life and all seems so strange
2021-11-01 10:08:59.800 Dean:    as after a while I tend to 'forget'
2021-11-01 10:08:46.520 Dean:    I do this regularly with quantum physics
2021-11-01 10:08:34.700 Dean:    but with my limited brain (like RAM) I need to refresh my synapses by exposing myself to it again
2021-11-01 10:07:49.880 Dean:    and at the time, it felt, for me, a much more elegant way of thinking about the duality of wave and particle duality
2021-11-01 10:07:15.840 Dean:    I have previously been exposed to it
2021-11-01 10:07:00.350 Dean:    and trying to get my head around it 
2021-11-01 10:06:44.640 Dean:    I have been reading about Pilot Wave Theory in Quantum Mechanics
2021-11-01 10:05:31.170 Dean:    except remove error trapping
2021-11-01 10:05:24.440 Dean:    to anything
2021-11-01 10:05:17.240 Dean:    I have made no fundamental changes to the program
2021-11-01 10:04:59.260 Dean:    interesting
2021-11-01 10:04:19.440 Dean:    I have  yet to test it on Win 10
2021-11-01 10:04:12.230 Dean:    so, if it fails on your PC it is either the Windows system itself or the specific version
2021-11-01 10:03:57.030 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 60  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1497
2021-11-01 10:03:40.070 Dean:    win 7
2021-11-01 10:03:37.550 Dean:    and it worked first time
2021-11-01 10:03:28.450 Dean:    I have just installed it on a 64bit system with little on it
2021-11-01 10:03:08.700 Dean:    
2021-11-01 10:03:03.170 Dean:    I do not expect the new FCW to start working but I am hoping the error shown may be more informative
2021-11-01 10:02:40.500 Dean:    
2021-11-01 10:02:36.990 Dean:    thought the keyword still exists
2021-11-01 10:02:21.950 Dean:    all other usages of GOTO are generally forbidden in practice
2021-11-01 10:01:56.490 Dean:    it is the only place where you are expected to use a GOTO
2021-11-01 10:01:34.890 Dean:    error trapping in VB6 is not one of its strengths
2021-11-01 10:01:19.200 Dean:    and one error trap in a function can handle a later error in another function if the error trap is not cancelled
2021-11-01 10:00:48.490 Dean:    (unlike me)
2021-11-01 10:00:39.680 Dean:    when I have imported functions from my libraries they often have erroro handling in place
2021-11-01 10:00:18.630 Dean:    and I generally prefer to see errors in the raw
2021-11-01 10:00:03.290 Dean:    to work...
2021-11-01 09:59:59.310 Dean:    reason being that it has to be in place for each and every function for it wo work
2021-11-01 09:59:37.540 Dean:    I have removed any error handling
2021-11-01 09:59:26.030 Dean:    save your older version first
2021-11-01 09:59:19.880 Dean:    feel free to test that
2021-11-01 09:59:12.580 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2021-11-01 08:55:38.310 Dean:    clocks back
2021-11-01 08:55:27.620 Dean:    Morning!
2021-10-31 21:28:06.700 Dean:    nightlyByeLode
2021-10-31 21:28:03.420 Dean:    off to bed nice and early
2021-10-31 19:08:26.880 Dean:    I see what you mean...
2021-10-31 18:55:00.400 Dean:    which will act as another backup
2021-10-31 18:54:49.140 Dean:    via a portable hard drive in an enclosure
2021-10-31 18:54:32.170 Dean:    just backing up my laptop to another system, all data
2021-10-31 18:54:15.600 Dean:    
2021-10-31 18:53:58.870 Dean:    takes longer of course
2021-10-31 18:53:52.480 Dean:    on the box, instead of those white blocks I always used wood triangles and glued them in place
2021-10-31 18:42:41.460 Dean:    those Chinese can be clever
2021-10-31 18:42:32.250 Dean:    something to watch out for though
2021-10-31 18:42:24.380 Dean:    I'm sure
2021-10-31 18:39:01.320 Dean:    too vicious
2021-10-31 18:38:48.300 Dean:    <><>plywood2.jpg
2021-10-31 18:37:43.630 Dean:    th
2021-10-31 18:37:41.630 Dean:    which is suprising as a lot of rather good tings have been made from Plywood
2021-10-31 18:37:17.820 Dean:    and plywood was never an option
2021-10-31 18:37:10.700 Dean:    we didn't have MDF in my day
2021-10-31 18:36:50.030 Dean:    it is exactly what I would do
2021-10-31 18:36:41.030 Dean:    I wan't picking holes in your box BTW
2021-10-31 18:36:30.730 Dean:    
2021-10-31 18:36:26.560 Dean:    that I'm too scared to use!
2021-10-31 18:36:17.410 Dean:    (I have one)
2021-10-31 18:36:07.130 Dean:    I don't have a bandsaw and I'm scared of the cutting wheel versions
2021-10-31 18:15:57.530 Dean:    if it blends in too well
2021-10-31 18:15:46.470 Dean:    you could pipe the  corners as it could be a trip hazard
2021-10-31 18:15:02.040 Dean:    I will use the same methods
2021-10-31 18:14:54.720 Dean:    two of them
2021-10-31 18:14:48.980 Dean:    I have to build more or less an identical version to that
2021-10-31 18:14:31.260 Dean:    a good box
2021-10-31 18:14:28.100 Dean:    but I see it for what it is
2021-10-31 18:14:11.150 Dean:    that was his motto
2021-10-31 18:13:57.670 Dean:    a good tight joint and a wedge will do...
2021-10-31 18:13:43.590 Dean:    screws were an anathema to him and glue was frowned upon
2021-10-31 18:13:12.500 Dean:    but he's been dead a few years now
2021-10-31 18:13:01.300 Dean:    my wood work teacher would have been annoyed at the lack of mortice and tenon joints
2021-10-31 18:12:34.130 Dean:    looks  good
2021-10-31 12:31:08.340 Dean:    I suppose all such ship/boat  pumps ought to be brass
