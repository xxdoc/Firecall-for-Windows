2022-01-20 17:26:06.105 Dean:    righto
2022-01-20 14:35:10.976 Dean:    lots of hoovering to do now though
2022-01-20 14:35:04.528 Dean:    
2022-01-20 14:34:31.889 Dean:    but it now works and I have done no significant harm to the battery
2022-01-20 14:34:14.001 Dean:    the battery is not quite as pretty as it used to be
2022-01-20 14:33:55.712 Dean:    and it operates it too
2022-01-20 14:33:50.569 Dean:    after surgery, the battery has been tested and it now fits the bike
2022-01-20 14:33:27.168 Dean:    that is drying now
2022-01-20 14:33:20.249 Dean:    this left a few small holes in the ABS which I have filled with black milliput
2022-01-20 14:32:52.761 Dean:    using the grinder I managed to cut away at thes econd batteryandtrim the sides, cut a lug space at the rear and give it a cutout at the front
2022-01-20 12:22:30.133 Dean:    I will now in detail
2022-01-20 11:43:51.412 Dean:    I will review
2022-01-20 10:38:50.876 Dean:    is the process, convert to a web widget then convert to a NW.js app?
2022-01-20 10:38:25.389 Dean:    might be useful to others considerig resurrecting an old widget too
2022-01-20 10:38:03.549 Dean:    but a documented example would be very useful as a reference
2022-01-20 10:37:43.461 Dean:    a guide would be nice
2022-01-20 10:37:38.196 Dean:    ?
2022-01-20 10:37:36.516 Dean:    can you dicument one of our shared widgets as a guide to allow me to dabble in a conversion
2022-01-20 10:36:41.517 Dean:    as I get bored I may dip my toe
2022-01-20 10:36:28.548 Dean:    but I will finish FCW and Steamydock first
2022-01-20 10:36:14.748 Dean:    you are right and I will make it my aim to migrate my widgets
2022-01-20 10:35:53.684 Dean:    re: NW.js

2022-01-20 10:18:32.117 Dean:    Hello!
2022-01-19 22:01:47.430 Dean:    bu I feel I ought
2022-01-19 22:01:42.007 Dean:    It will take me a while to get going on mine
2022-01-19 19:55:41.086 Dean:    frameless?
2022-01-19 19:55:33.805 Dean:    Do you think it will be possible to rewrite all our widgets and get them to operate using NW.js?
2022-01-19 19:54:54.952 Dean:    they aren't
2022-01-19 19:54:50.766 Dean:    the should be the same
2022-01-19 19:54:29.238 Dean:    battery 2
2022-01-19 19:54:24.809 Dean:    <><>271646528_509390030487147_8040886905908708080_n.jpg
2022-01-19 19:54:22.150 Dean:    battery 1

2022-01-19 18:39:37.270 Dean:    interesting
2022-01-19 14:25:07.957 Dean:    photos to come
2022-01-19 14:24:54.997 Dean:    it should then fit
2022-01-19 14:24:50.828 Dean:    all along both sides
2022-01-19 14:24:40.909 Dean:    so a a grinder will be required to remove some plastic
2022-01-19 14:24:27.461 Dean:    but not very well...
2022-01-19 14:24:06.445 Dean:    and they are probably copying another's battery type
2022-01-19 14:23:50.621 Dean:    the manufacturers are all in China
2022-01-19 14:23:39.589 Dean:    whent he battery is in situ
2022-01-19 14:23:31.245 Dean:    but the amount of force needed to connect and disconnect is beyond normal human capability
2022-01-19 14:23:07.085 Dean:    meaning the battery form and connections are all good
2022-01-19 14:22:56.021 Dean:    and the slot by which the batteries are secured are tighter by 3-4mm
2022-01-19 14:22:26.261 Dean:    some lugs are wider by 2mm
2022-01-19 14:22:16.241 Dean:    it seems the second companyhas followed the same form factor but had made changes to suit their own manufacturing
2022-01-19 14:21:41.740 Dean:    measuring and checking to see why not
2022-01-19 14:21:32.629 Dean:    I have a second battery of the same type but ti does not fit
2022-01-19 14:21:20.468 Dean:    been working on the bike
2022-01-19 14:20:59.685 Dean:    if they had all been orientated north-south we wouldn't have this problem :)
2022-01-19 14:20:37.613 Dean:    it is inconvenient of them to have built all the roads East to West
2022-01-19 10:25:59.526 Dean:

2022-01-18 23:30:16.203 Dean:    TuttyByeLode
2022-01-18 22:17:03.232 Dean:    just testing the quotation functionality in FCW
2022-01-18 22:16:38.476 Dean:    very interesrting
2022-01-18 22:16:04.066 Dean:    [quote] Frameless apps do not have a title bar for the user to click and drag the window. You can use CSS to designate DOM elements as draggable regions. [/quote] 
2022-01-18 21:09:15.237 Dean:    and a lot going on
2022-01-18 21:09:10.600 Dean:    as I have a lot to do
2022-01-18 21:09:06.201 Dean:    give me a while
2022-01-18 21:08:58.816 Dean:    I will need some help from you setting it up
2022-01-18 21:08:48.019 Dean:    I will have a go at NW.js
2022-01-18 21:04:37.172 Dean:    those work benches, all three look the job
2022-01-18 21:04:18.735 Dean:    the indoor workshop looks good
2022-01-18 21:01:55.937 Dean:    I have to admit
2022-01-18 21:01:51.544 Dean:    th attenuator does look good
2022-01-18 13:24:16.221 Dean:    oh well
2022-01-18 13:24:01.973 Dean:    I have seen forums complaining that they could not download even in 2009
2022-01-18 13:23:41.877 Dean:    it seems that even his archive files were corrupt from the very beginning
2022-01-18 13:16:21.626 Dean:    and obviously lost interest
2022-01-18 13:16:12.980 Dean:    he failed to give it a annovative name
2022-01-18 13:15:42.008 Dean:    but I suppose he failed to take it forward
2022-01-18 13:15:26.387 Dean:    I Was actively scanning at that time
2022-01-18 13:15:17.067 Dean:    still an impressie bit of work
2022-01-18 13:14:59.952 Dean:    how amazing that we missed it
2022-01-18 13:14:48.015 Dean:    yes
2022-01-18 13:03:23.795 Dean:    uses the chap's own script engine
2022-01-18 13:02:33.595 Dean:     the .7z downloads are all corrupt
2022-01-18 13:02:00.572 Dean:    GUI
2022-01-18 13:01:56.968 Dean:    and uses Delphi as the scripting language
2022-01-18 13:01:48.932 Dean:    GI designer
2022-01-18 13:01:45.701 Dean:    it has an editor
2022-01-18 13:01:40.740 Dean:    have you seen that one before?
2022-01-18 12:45:57.592 Dean:    https://www.delphipraxis.net/119493-desktop-widget-engine-v0-72-a.html
2022-01-18 12:45:56.344 Dean:    ich denke
2022-01-18 12:45:46.481 Dean:    du bist besser als mich
2022-01-18 12:45:13.886 Dean:    
2022-01-18 12:45:10.267 Dean:    you are better than me 
2022-01-18 12:45:04.385 Dean:    any good at German?
2022-01-18 12:44:57.987 Dean:    
2022-01-18 12:36:34.541 Dean:    and although I like .js for me, it isn't the be all and end all
2022-01-18 12:36:06.607 Dean:    it is not aiming to put widgets n the desktop seamlessly
2022-01-18 12:35:46.238 Dean:    I like .js but the direction of the frameworks is not 'ours' I feel
2022-01-18 12:35:13.672 Dean:    time to check perhaps
2022-01-18 12:35:07.036 Dean:    and certainly not native
2022-01-18 12:34:59.142 Dean:    a few years back it was possible but not easy
2022-01-18 12:34:39.682 Dean:    I think it might be time to see how easy this might be in Delphi with Lazarus
2022-01-18 12:34:17.648 Dean:    it could be Delphi
2022-01-18 12:34:09.393 Dean:    the language at that point is immaterial
2022-01-18 12:33:53.663 Dean:    then a code editor that jumps to the object's events automaticall on dbl click
2022-01-18 12:32:56.690 Dean:    or they can be disabled and controls switched off
2022-01-18 12:32:33.594 Dean:    native support and design for transparent programs, no form controls 
2022-01-18 12:32:06.613 Dean:    that is the starting point
2022-01-18 12:32:00.919 Dean:    just like xwidgets IDE but just done better
2022-01-18 12:31:48.433 Dean:    something similar to the VB6 IDE taht allows drop and place
2022-01-18 12:31:31.986 Dean:    
2022-01-18 12:31:25.038 Dean:    and without that anything else feels like a kludge
2022-01-18 12:31:10.683 Dean:    I need that IDE to build apps in aRAD fashion
2022-01-18 12:30:51.781 Dean:    I think it is native transparency support with the IDE that is my target
2022-01-18 12:30:08.633 Dean:    What I really want is xwidget with Konfabulator underneath
2022-01-18 12:29:36.177 Dean:    I also want a designer and IDE
2022-01-18 12:29:25.875 Dean:    NWJS feels like a series of bodges to me
2022-01-18 12:29:01.094 Dean:    I need to see something like one of my apps running windowless on the desktop to believe it
2022-01-18 12:15:51.025 Dean:    If it requires learning a new language then I'd do it
2022-01-18 12:15:24.727 Dean:    natively on the desktop
2022-01-18 12:15:09.844 Dean:    I want the capability to create windowless apps with transparencies both behind and layered
2022-01-18 12:14:43.197 Dean:    It isn't so much .js for me
2022-01-18 11:25:24.153 Dean:    if we could find that, even if it involved a new language it might be worth pursuing
2022-01-18 11:24:51.243 Dean:    specifically graphical programs that operate without forms and traditional windows
2022-01-18 11:24:22.866 Dean:    we need to find a new environment and runtime that will allow us to create the specialised programs that we create
2022-01-18 11:23:55.653 Dean:    
2022-01-18 11:23:55.243 Dean:    
2022-01-18 09:55:08.790 Dean:    as long as I make progress that will be a learning lesson for me
2022-01-18 09:54:47.589 Dean:    FCW later today I will set about creating that class and dumping the email functionality into that
2022-01-18 09:53:40.846 Dean:    all I need to ensure is the batteries' actual charge and discharge rates are the same
2022-01-18 09:53:02.837 Dean:    I am replicating it basically
2022-01-18 09:52:48.017 Dean:    I have dismnatled my abttery pack so I am aware of its construction
2022-01-18 09:52:31.508 Dean:    
2022-01-18 09:52:31.349 Dean:    
2022-01-18 09:52:26.468 Dean:    visible over parts of the UK last week
2022-01-18 09:51:03.229 Dean:    I see it
2022-01-18 09:31:27.866 Dean:    and connectors/correct gauge wire
2022-01-18 09:31:13.852 Dean:    then some wrapping tape
2022-01-18 09:31:05.046 Dean:    spot welding
2022-01-18 09:30:59.964 Dean:    and a method of welding the batteries together
2022-01-18 09:30:45.766 Dean:    I need a BMS module
2022-01-18 09:30:38.092 Dean:    and I am ammassing the parts
2022-01-18 09:30:26.379 Dean:    my intention is to build a couple of battery packs for my electric bike
2022-01-18 09:29:48.792 Dean:    I have testing device coming that will be able to discharge each battery and let me know the real capacity and discharge rate
2022-01-18 09:29:11.383 Dean:    appearing from various sources
2022-01-18 09:29:03.354 Dean:    over time
2022-01-18 09:28:58.259 Dean:    I now have about 40 batteries
2022-01-18 09:28:45.675 Dean:    the others are fine
2022-01-18 09:28:39.811 Dean:    it was the charging circuitry or a lone battery that failed
2022-01-18 09:28:24.523 Dean:    in almost all cases the batteries have not been at fault
2022-01-18 09:28:02.966 Dean:    and dropping to about 82-85%
2022-01-18 09:27:50.513 Dean:    losing only 0.3v
2022-01-18 09:27:35.027 Dean:    each has recovered amazing ly well
2022-01-18 09:27:23.156 Dean:    and then retest the voltage drop, write that on the battery, recharge and do the same
2022-01-18 09:27:02.323 Dean:    and left for 18 months
2022-01-18 09:26:54.749 Dean:    then I recharged
2022-01-18 09:26:47.607 Dean:    when I extract I test the voltage and write that on the battery body and the date
2022-01-18 09:26:14.128 Dean:    I have been testing each battery over 18 months
2022-01-18 09:25:58.996 Dean:    and I extract the batteries using mechanical means
2022-01-18 09:25:38.140 Dean:    each pack has failed over time
2022-01-18 09:25:21.745 Dean:    he enclosed ones that do not allow access to the underlying batteries
2022-01-18 09:25:05.312 Dean:    I have been removing 18650 batteriee from old laptop batteries

2022-01-17 23:23:50.151 Dean:    eating other people's food is always more fun thant your own
2022-01-17 23:23:36.160 Dean:    I'd love to try it
2022-01-17 23:23:21.792 Dean:    but fun
2022-01-17 23:23:12.495 Dean:    mine is less healthy
2022-01-17 23:23:02.120 Dean:    all cottage pie recipes are good
2022-01-17 23:22:39.743 Dean:    very tasty
2022-01-17 23:22:36.199 Dean:    oil
2022-01-17 23:22:33.984 Dean:    fry those in oild
2022-01-17 23:22:29.952 Dean:    then reduce the potato by peeling the flesh in a long continuous strip
2022-01-17 23:22:04.391 Dean:    peel first
2022-01-17 23:22:00.616 Dean:    and we will make potato strips using the peeler
2022-01-17 23:21:40.880 Dean:    tomorrow we are having steak, just the two of us, me and my boy
2022-01-17 23:20:45.464 Dean:    and very cheap indeed
2022-01-17 23:20:35.375 Dean:    extremely good

2022-01-17 23:18:03.260 Dean:    do you have one?
2022-01-17 23:17:56.696 Dean:    I use a potato peeling machine
2022-01-17 23:17:46.232 Dean:    very heavy indeed
2022-01-17 23:17:30.472 Dean:    i fed six of us, we all had seconds and 30% was still left
2022-01-17 23:17:02.478 Dean:    by the way that cottage pie was much bigger than it looks
2022-01-17 23:14:12.661 Dean:    and so tasty on a Winter's evening
2022-01-17 23:14:04.488 Dean:    Such a good mix
2022-01-17 23:13:52.589 Dean:    carrots and brussel sprouts went in with the meat
2022-01-17 23:13:13.952 Dean:    and a pinch of chilli flakes
2022-01-17 23:13:01.095 Dean:    the mince was beef, with one onion chopped, a tin of lentils, tin of tomatoes, garlic, Lea and Perrins Worcester, a table spoon of marmite, three beef oxos, salt and pepper
2022-01-17 23:11:59.488 Dean:    
2022-01-17 23:11:41.040 Dean:    cheddar on top and inside
2022-01-17 23:11:34.975 Dean:    grate cheese too
2022-01-17 23:11:26.768 Dean:    with a teaspoon of English mustard
2022-01-17 23:11:12.919 Dean:    mixed with mascarpone cheese, single cream and a large chunk of butter
2022-01-17 23:10:42.760 Dean:    made the mash using potatoes from a friend's farm
2022-01-17 23:10:27.929 Dean:    it was good
2022-01-17 20:02:58.177 Dean:    <><>cottagePie.png
2022-01-17 19:57:19.212 Dean:    2 degrees
2022-01-17 19:57:13.732 Dean:    cold here too
2022-01-17 19:37:16.452 Dean:    s
2022-01-17 19:37:15.284 Dean:    I think you need to rewrite the desktop hole uding a new language
2022-01-17 19:36:51.803 Dean:    so, why the pronouncement on giving up widgets?
2022-01-17 16:39:08.776 Dean:    as he is learning smallBasic at school now
2022-01-17 16:38:58.432 Dean:    but we are just going over them afresh
2022-01-17 16:38:49.363 Dean:    things he learnt before
2022-01-17 16:38:41.308 Dean:    integers, booleans, strings &c
2022-01-17 16:38:22.411 Dean:    and how naughty a GOTO is
2022-01-17 16:38:11.835 Dean:    intitialising vars, arrays, labels and GOTOs
2022-01-17 16:37:44.428 Dean:    just taught my boy variable declarations, functions and sub routines
2022-01-17 16:31:28.107 Dean:    just testing
2022-01-17 16:31:18.630 Dean:    ToodlePip!
2022-01-17 14:54:39.427 Dean:    TTFN
2022-01-17 14:54:37.379 Dean:    except for xwidgets/rainwidgets, both of which are stillborn
2022-01-17 14:54:16.483 Dean:    I have come across nothing like it since
2022-01-17 14:54:06.291 Dean:    in .js
2022-01-17 14:53:58.962 Dean:    still there is nothing as good as YWE for putting good looking, functional programs on your dekstop
2022-01-17 14:53:13.061 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:53:04.387 Dean:    then multiplatform with adoption of different graphic options but that is a long way off
2022-01-17 14:52:38.601 Dean:    the code will be Windows specific in the first phase
2022-01-17 14:52:10.674 Dean:    I am in touch with one developer and the other is making amazing progress
2022-01-17 14:51:49.995 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:51:48.307 Dean:    so VB6 is the way forward for me at the moment
2022-01-17 14:51:38.602 Dean:    and I DO have TwinBasic/RADBasic as the next generation of  VB6+
2022-01-17 14:51:02.996 Dean:    but not for a long while yet I feel
2022-01-17 14:50:52.915 Dean:    When FCW is done in VB6 I will look at converting it upwards
2022-01-17 14:50:07.660 Dean:    otherwise it is Windows all the way I am afraid!
2022-01-17 14:49:55.985 Dean:    then we can still communicate
2022-01-17 14:49:44.662 Dean:    if you fancy writing FCW in a multi platform tool such as VB.NET
2022-01-17 14:49:00.845 Dean:    but I WILL do it.
2022-01-17 14:48:54.739 Dean:    I may be slow
2022-01-17 14:48:47.667 Dean:    I will complete FCW and Steamydock
2022-01-17 14:48:36.755 Dean:    and they will run there
2022-01-17 14:48:30.261 Dean:    but you still have windows
2022-01-17 14:48:16.739 Dean:    as it is holding your o/s back
2022-01-17 14:48:07.179 Dean:    you may be at that point where you need to move on with YWE on Mac
2022-01-17 14:47:48.081 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:47:39.620 Dean:    just not straightforward when you try to do things that are 'clever'
2022-01-17 14:47:17.738 Dean:    VB6 is very enjoyable
2022-01-17 14:47:11.000 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:47:08.228 Dean:    might as well leanr C#
2022-01-17 14:46:59.810 Dean:    implemented in C# style
2022-01-17 14:46:48.862 Dean:    I have tried VB.NET and it is a hodgepodge
2022-01-17 14:46:35.338 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:46:33.283 Dean:    they just wrap them up and present them differently
2022-01-17 14:46:21.075 Dean:    all the later frameworks come down to using APIs in the end
2022-01-17 14:45:58.883 Dean:    and familiarity with Win APIs is exposure to the real world, closer to the metal as it were
2022-01-17 14:45:34.987 Dean:    in addition due to VB6's limitations, it forces me to use the o/s APIs
2022-01-17 14:45:15.186 Dean:    
2022-01-17 14:45:00.181 Dean:    so more lessons learnt
2022-01-17 14:44:54.331 Dean:     and it is forcing me to write my first class module
2022-01-17 14:44:44.443 Dean:    so I am learning a practical lesson
2022-01-17 14:44:35.051 Dean:    the VB6 limitastion I just described is also a limitation of the successor VB.NET
2022-01-17 14:44:09.379 Dean:    and would be lost without their functionality on my desktop
2022-01-17 14:43:56.987 Dean:    I use the gauges all the time
2022-01-17 14:43:41.019 Dean:    I am using the media player now
2022-01-17 14:43:31.555 Dean:    I would not do without them
2022-01-17 14:43:22.291 Dean:    and they do function SO very well
2022-01-17 14:43:14.427 Dean:    as they just work on windows
2022-01-17 14:43:04.811 Dean:    I am no longer creating any widgets but I will continue to run them
2022-01-17 14:42:35.939 Dean:    and I have not completed my projects so I will stick with it
2022-01-17 14:42:18.558 Dean:    Well VB6 is all I know except for .js
2022-01-17 13:56:11.542 Dean:    to keep warm
2022-01-17 13:56:08.112 Dean:    wearing fingerless gloves
2022-01-17 13:56:02.072 Dean:    sorry about typos
2022-01-17 13:54:43.079 Dean:    
2022-01-17 13:54:32.466 Dean:    we'll see how that goes
2022-01-17 13:54:19.444 Dean:    so, I need to fihure that out
2022-01-17 13:54:08.811 Dean:    and reference it from there
2022-01-17 13:53:56.378 Dean:    so now I have to take my working code, encapsulate it into a class
2022-01-17 13:53:36.927 Dean:    to share the email code I need to put it into a module but it no longer works with events
2022-01-17 13:53:08.263 Dean:    it has to be in a FORM or similar
2022-01-17 13:52:59.720 Dean:    as code at the shared level cannot handle events
2022-01-17 13:52:37.067 Dean:    and these variables have to be declared at the form level
2022-01-17 13:52:17.594 Dean:    but the soultion uses a privater variable WITHEVENTS rhat allows it to reaspond to external events
2022-01-17 13:51:45.531 Dean:    the program works well in the prefs
2022-01-17 13:51:34.710 Dean:    having a little problem with getting FCW to email
2022-01-17 13:51:16.526 Dean:    
2022-01-17 10:56:22.310 Dean:    the new version of VB6 TwinBasic will have that compileIf
2022-01-17 10:55:50.604 Dean:    but it would be something I could have used in that situation
2022-01-17 10:55:09.181 Dean:    but not any code that should not be compiled
2022-01-17 10:54:54.389 Dean:    I have code that when compiled should only be run if the code is in the IDE and vice versa
2022-01-17 10:54:11.062 Dean:    I like the idea
2022-01-17 10:54:05.732 Dean:    I have not encountered them before
2022-01-17 10:20:22.245 Dean:    new to me
2022-01-17 10:20:19.265 Dean:    have you ever come across a compileIF statement?
2022-01-17 10:19:50.101 Dean:    
2022-01-17 10:19:46.881 Dean:    as only a deep sleep can provide
2022-01-17 10:19:37.270 Dean:    feeling refreshed
2022-01-17 09:31:14.740 Dean:    good deep sleep
2022-01-17 09:30:58.125 Dean:     Windspeed is 6 knots, force 2, direction WSW

2022-01-16 22:10:01.464 Dean:    off to bed soon
2022-01-16 22:01:52.663 Dean:    but they were well liked
2022-01-16 22:01:45.279 Dean:    not my sort of thing
2022-01-16 22:01:34.424 Dean:    I remember them well

2022-01-16 20:26:39.519 Dean:    went cycling yesterday briefly
2022-01-16 20:26:30.968 Dean:    
2022-01-16 20:18:54.698 Dean:    I need some cottage pie
2022-01-16 20:18:38.267 Dean:    just one bit of work to do and it will be done
2022-01-16 20:18:24.684 Dean:    My own personal emails all seem to be working again
2022-01-16 20:18:10.523 Dean:    
2022-01-16 20:17:56.933 Dean:    putting the structure in place
2022-01-16 20:17:40.278 Dean:    and then writing the value to the settings.ini, reading it back &c
2022-01-16 20:17:19.773 Dean:    writing and checking a lastEmailDate
2022-01-16 20:17:05.984 Dean:    I am working on the email functionality
2022-01-16 20:16:24.479 Dean:    LOVED that
2022-01-16 20:16:18.888 Dean:    Elsa once asked a Dutch lady on a bus if an Uitvaart Centrum (they were passing) was a sort of travel agency.
2022-01-16 20:16:13.848 Dean:    
2022-01-16 20:00:08.559 Dean:    hard day here with hangiover and mum combined
2022-01-16 15:46:34.254 Dean:    my head is cloudy
2022-01-16 15:46:27.357 Dean:    slowly looking at my code
2022-01-16 10:24:26.333 Dean:    foolish me
2022-01-16 10:24:19.692 Dean:    Bit too sloshed last night
2022-01-15 13:53:14.112 Dean:    seems to be working well
2022-01-15 13:53:00.248 Dean:    easy to do in the IDE but requires msgbox pop ups when compiled
2022-01-15 13:52:39.912 Dean:    just testing my timer logic
2022-01-15 13:52:24.784 Dean:    verge in French supposedly means penis
2022-01-15 13:52:12.288 Dean:    "soft verge"
2022-01-15 13:51:57.672 Dean:    wir farhen gegen England

2022-01-15 11:59:56.160 Dean:    when you see my code it will explain itself better than I just did

2022-01-15 11:58:58.964 Dean:    
2022-01-15 11:58:17.503 Dean:    and I hope/am sure that timers will emerge that have support for intervals greater than 65536 millisecs
2022-01-15 11:57:30.449 Dean:    when TwinBasic/RADBasic emerges
2022-01-15 11:57:15.786 Dean:    all this will be done away with
2022-01-15 11:56:59.680 Dean:    and that calls the logic itself
2022-01-15 11:56:50.623 Dean:    that is initiated when the codeTimer does its stuff
2022-01-15 11:56:29.808 Dean:    that is a callback routine
2022-01-15 11:56:23.352 Dean:    and finally, there is another routine
2022-01-15 11:42:34.512 Dean:    if I want a timer that operates with values > 65536 msecs and one that operates in the IDE
2022-01-15 11:42:00.436 Dean:    but that is how it must be
2022-01-15 11:41:53.088 Dean:    a bit overly complicated
2022-01-15 11:41:44.367 Dean:    
2022-01-15 11:41:42.103 Dean:    and as the logic is the same for each, these are just stubs that call another routine containing the logic
2022-01-15 11:41:15.312 Dean:    the next two routines are the equivalent of each other and contain the code that is called directly by the timers
2022-01-15 11:39:36.392 Dean:    the first routine is called at startup and calls either the VB6 timer or the code timer
2022-01-15 11:39:27.136 Dean:    we have two equivalent timers, one for VB6 and one in code
2022-01-15 11:38:28.632 Dean:    each timer has five routines assocoaiated with it
2022-01-15 11:13:45.488 Dean:    tidying up my timer code to ensure it is a little more readable and logical
2022-01-15 11:13:20.255 Dean:    
2022-01-15 11:13:15.553 Dean:    let me know how you got on

2022-01-14 16:25:22.893 Dean:    yes the writing of the encrypted pwd is adding the blank lines

2022-01-14 16:08:13.673 Dean:    so the pwd acts incorrectly when empty
2022-01-14 16:07:55.957 Dean:    you have the old version
2022-01-14 14:40:27.573 Dean:    I'll allow renaming of the config slots later
2022-01-14 14:39:59.036 Dean:    I have handled an empty password field
2022-01-14 14:18:36.204 Dean:    and I do need to do something about the empty password field
2022-01-14 14:18:21.996 Dean:    You will be able to name the configuration options
2022-01-14 14:08:07.700 Dean:    eg. smtpAuthenticate0=1
2022-01-14 14:07:47.037 Dean:    and add a 0 ot the name of the config options
2022-01-14 14:07:36.977 Dean:    edit the settings.ini
2022-01-14 14:07:30.363 Dean:    or 
2022-01-14 14:07:27.627 Dean:    you may have to re-enter your settings
2022-01-14 14:07:08.932 Dean:    but OK for testing

2022-01-14 00:17:57.683 Dean:    FCW modified to allow saving of up to five SMTP configs
2022-01-13 21:00:08.873 Dean:    we also have an emergency hoist with a brake that allows anyone to escape from the third floor
2022-01-13 20:59:10.193 Dean:    it allows someone to climb out and down most of the way
2022-01-13 20:58:54.297 Dean:    we have a rolled up ladder which we attach to a window ledge and throw out the window
2022-01-13 20:58:25.742 Dean:    do you have an escape ladder for your apartment?

2022-01-13 10:51:06.614 Dean:    you could get them to install a solar panel and an aerial or two whilst they are up there
2022-01-13 10:50:47.716 Dean:    do you know what they are up to?

2022-01-11 22:09:14.758 Dean:    is there any surviving original code written in IMP?
2022-01-11 22:08:47.951 Dean:    so it means the language survives and can be used again
2022-01-11 22:08:13.710 Dean:    and it is then compiled using gcc
2022-01-11 22:07:55.929 Dean:    so, it has aparser that converts to C?
2022-01-11 17:55:49.103 Dean:    what does it  run on now?
2022-01-11 17:55:39.111 Dean:    Who wrote the latest version?

2022-01-11 13:30:56.610 Dean:    I Was also using it to communicate with someone
2022-01-11 13:30:46.037 Dean:    and so nothing to worry about
2022-01-11 13:30:32.676 Dean:    now I log in and see I was half way through an update

2022-01-11 13:29:50.157 Dean:    unfinished transfer
2022-01-11 13:29:44.365 Dean:    Well sort of
2022-01-11 13:29:39.389 Dean:    No
2022-01-11 11:26:52.906 Dean:    which I intend to use
2022-01-11 11:26:47.126 Dean:    so I was stuck out of github
2022-01-11 11:26:35.543 Dean:    I had changed ti but not noted the change nor was it saved in the browser
2022-01-11 11:26:20.649 Dean:    I have managed to reset my github password
2022-01-11 11:25:56.082 Dean:    email now appears to be working again

2022-01-10 12:52:02.879 Dean:    github for example
2022-01-10 12:51:55.927 Dean:    but the email is tturning out to be essential as I had registered a few places using it
2022-01-10 12:51:31.319 Dean:    I have enough time to consider it if not to do it
2022-01-10 12:51:14.887 Dean:    thinking about it
2022-01-10 12:50:57.175 Dean:    I think I might experiment
2022-01-10 12:05:43.763 Dean:    quicker than expected
2022-01-10 12:04:55.156 Dean:    a bit more email repair and I will be running on all email cylinders
2022-01-10 12:03:37.777 Dean:    next time I will not trust my domain registrar
2022-01-10 11:38:49.008 Dean:    give it 24hrs
2022-01-10 11:37:25.471 Dean:    the email may start to operate now - incoming
2022-01-10 11:36:49.991 Dean:    latest version
2022-01-10 11:36:38.143 Dean:    uncustomised
2022-01-10 11:36:32.199 Dean:    new installation
2022-01-10 11:36:28.081 Dean:    it does not even appear using firefox

2022-01-10 11:11:41.696 Dean:    or use Chrome!
2022-01-10 11:11:35.207 Dean:    so I have two browser open in order to do anything
2022-01-10 11:11:21.543 Dean:    and TSOhosts live chat does not operate in Firefox
2022-01-10 11:11:09.047 Dean:    As an aside, TSOhost Cpanel only operates in Firefox and not my default browser Palemoon
2022-01-10 11:10:28.951 Dean:    but I'll let them do that
2022-01-10 11:10:17.903 Dean:    easy enough
2022-01-10 11:10:13.847 Dean:    so I have to manually change the nameservers to the default
2022-01-10 11:09:53.679 Dean:    but it seems that they have a button that you select that does nothing during the transfer
2022-01-10 11:09:30.311 Dean:    I wanted to make the transfer simple...
2022-01-10 11:09:09.783 Dean:    despite me requesting that they use the default nameservers 
2022-01-10 11:08:51.151 Dean:    it seems that the nameservers are still those that were transferred over
2022-01-10 10:59:14.951 Dean:    with live chat at TSOhosts
2022-01-10 10:59:03.374 Dean:    just working on the MX record propagation
2022-01-10 10:58:24.806 Dean:    
2022-01-10 10:58:21.832 Dean:    so, a rewrite of that section is required or adding a delay
2022-01-10 10:58:00.063 Dean:    but it appears that it is not doing what it should do
2022-01-10 10:57:43.567 Dean:    I added some checks to see if the stream was already open and being written to
2022-01-10 10:57:20.118 Dean:    
2022-01-10 09:59:08.711 Dean:    but FCW does improve...
2022-01-10 09:58:54.854 Dean:    the list never shortens
2022-01-10 09:58:48.167 Dean:    I am gathering the runtime errors in my list
2022-01-10 09:58:21.943 Dean:    is when Dropbox has had its knickers in a twist and is perpetually synching the output file due to a large queu and slow network times in Dropbox#
2022-01-10 09:57:45.966 Dean:    the only other time it has occurred
2022-01-10 09:57:39.031 Dean:    
2022-01-10 09:57:36.148 Dean:    at the o/s level
2022-01-10 09:57:18.126 Dean:    I thinkthe next write occurs before the o/s has had time to write and close the previous stream
2022-01-10 09:56:46.352 Dean:    and that should sort it
2022-01-10 09:56:33.655 Dean:    I think I my have to inject a delay or convert all the pasted lines to one long stream
2022-01-10 09:56:07.654 Dean:    using the same routine as for just one line but calling it multiple times
2022-01-10 09:55:51.318 Dean:    at the moment I am going through the process of converting to a stream and writing it for each line
2022-01-10 09:55:26.399 Dean:    but it should not need it
2022-01-10 09:55:19.191 Dean:    so a delay might sort it

2022-01-09 23:11:33.217 Dean:    hard to pin down
2022-01-09 23:11:28.317 Dean:    the file write method might need a delay in between writes
2022-01-09 23:11:05.657 Dean:    that's happened to me too
2022-01-09 23:10:59.457 Dean:    yes
2022-01-09 22:40:37.665 Dean:    but my guess is that the propagation has not been triggered
2022-01-09 22:40:18.153 Dean:    and it is correct
2022-01-09 22:40:14.897 Dean:    I can view its setting at this end on the dashboard
2022-01-09 22:39:25.713 Dean:    and that needs to be replaced
2022-01-09 22:39:18.696 Dean:    pointing elsewhere
2022-01-09 22:39:11.945 Dean:    yes, that is the old MX record
2022-01-09 20:26:18.888 Dean:    I won't receive that reply
2022-01-09 19:35:51.442 Dean:    but not for long!
2022-01-09 19:29:45.984 Dean:    so I have special dispensation from my own SWMBO
2022-01-09 19:29:33.648 Dean:    too cold to work on outside
2022-01-09 19:29:27.568 Dean:    That's my bike in the kitchen

2022-01-09 19:28:59.304 Dean:    and less so my amperage as they are all mostly the same
2022-01-09 19:28:43.481 Dean:    the batteries are sorted by voltage and type
2022-01-09 19:28:29.144 Dean:    it has three drawers
2022-01-09 19:28:23.040 Dean:    added compartments the correct size for various batteries
2022-01-09 19:28:09.087 Dean:    made from an artists portable easel and carrying case
2022-01-09 19:27:45.541 Dean:    Thats is my battery box

2022-01-09 19:27:24.244 Dean:    my fingers are almost used to the key feel and travel
2022-01-09 19:27:10.536 Dean:    and it is doing me well
2022-01-09 19:27:05.192 Dean:    Mac
2022-01-09 19:27:00.860 Dean:    I have modified the keys with some stickers on the old mack keyboard

2022-01-09 19:26:12.832 Dean:    
2022-01-09 19:23:05.664 Dean:    just emailed you from LQ
2022-01-09 19:22:57.032 Dean:    
2022-01-09 19:21:49.848 Dean:    with the specs on the net
2022-01-09 19:21:42.296 Dean:    checking the amperage of each type
2022-01-09 19:21:27.190 Dean:    thinking of building a bike battery
2022-01-09 19:21:16.128 Dean:    but still quite good after 18 months
2022-01-09 19:21:03.688 Dean:    just three are showing a problem, not holding a charge quite as well
2022-01-09 19:20:42.000 Dean:    hardly any change to 90% of them
2022-01-09 19:20:32.040 Dean:    if they have and by how much
2022-01-09 19:20:24.520 Dean:    18 mnths later doing the same to see how they have discharged
2022-01-09 19:20:12.448 Dean:    wrote th initial values on the sides, charged them, updated the values
2022-01-09 19:19:54.032 Dean:    salvaged 30+ 18 months ago
2022-01-09 19:19:35.715 Dean:    testing 18650 batteries here salvaged from old laptops
2022-01-09 19:19:21.887 Dean:    
2022-01-09 19:19:15.638 Dean:    or the changes have failed to propagate
2022-01-09 19:19:06.353 Dean:    so there is a misconfiguration with the MX record
2022-01-09 19:18:51.808 Dean:    but incoming are not
2022-01-09 19:18:46.128 Dean:    as I said, all outgoing emails are sending
2022-01-09 19:18:33.329 Dean:    so it hould all kick into operation
2022-01-09 19:18:22.072 Dean:    The domain and the nameservers are all registered with the same host
2022-01-09 19:17:49.436 Dean:    not so bothered about the site
2022-01-09 19:17:40.779 Dean:    working on email records first
2022-01-09 18:41:33.374 Dean:    I am using supposedly the Incoming Server: 	sxb1plzcpnl453525.prod.sxb1.secureserver.net
2022-01-09 18:40:44.238 Dean:    that is the server id

2022-01-09 11:28:57.420 Dean:    but summat is wrong
2022-01-09 11:28:53.320 Dean:    I am using the server's name servers and it should all have worked
2022-01-09 11:28:01.185 Dean:    so that I can send an email but anyone who sends me one, it disappears into the ether
2022-01-09 11:27:30.339 Dean:    it seems that with my email problem I have an account that has been resurrected, I re-rgistered the domain but the MX record has not propagated around the net

2022-01-08 16:17:58.338 Dean:    tired still
2022-01-07 23:02:23.252 Dean:    an early night for me I think
2022-01-07 23:02:00.363 Dean:    but I am too tired
2022-01-07 23:01:51.420 Dean:    I was going to take the bike out for an evening cycle
2022-01-07 18:33:42.061 Dean:    Did you hear about Norton implementing crypto mining on user's PC by default?
2022-01-07 18:33:11.553 Dean:    
2022-01-07 18:32:17.433 Dean:    and I might take it out tonight
2022-01-07 18:32:07.307 Dean:    now recharging
2022-01-07 18:32:00.626 Dean:    took it for a ride, just 6-7 miles
2022-01-07 18:31:49.446 Dean:    resolved the battery problem, repackaged the battery and inserted inside the shell
2022-01-07 18:31:24.719 Dean:    I repaired my bike today
2022-01-07 18:31:15.598 Dean:    
2022-01-07 18:31:09.557 Dean:    has it improved the clattering/shaking?
2022-01-07 10:31:25.142 Dean:    fixing!
2022-01-07 10:31:21.086 Dean:    no coding today

2022-01-05 17:37:13.353 Dean:    hope the boat craning out of the dock went well
2022-01-05 17:36:57.781 Dean:    
2022-01-05 17:36:57.221 Dean:    This email work has caused me to tidy up my emails altogether
2022-01-05 17:36:30.008 Dean:    recovering old emails from my old email package on another system
2022-01-05 14:14:58.370 Dean:    almost made that change
2022-01-05 14:14:54.009 Dean:    
2022-01-05 12:13:44.629 Dean:    sometimes the email settings are incorrectly set by idiot admins on the server side
2022-01-05 12:13:12.312 Dean:    and you never know what they might be trying to do
2022-01-05 12:13:02.379 Dean:    I have encountered some interesting combinations
2022-01-05 12:12:43.461 Dean:    it will be down to the user to select what has been enabled for his server
2022-01-05 12:12:04.602 Dean:    I am not going to limit the port selections
2022-01-05 12:11:53.116 Dean:    
2022-01-05 12:11:44.051 Dean:    just testing it
2022-01-05 12:11:38.061 Dean:    I have added a SMTP config dropdown and selection
2022-01-05 11:02:53.654 Dean:    '    smtpuserPassword1

2022-01-05 11:02:38.749 Dean:    '
2022-01-05 11:01:48.328 Dean:    ' add a combobox dropdown to the smtp server section that allows selection of smtp configs
2022-01-05 11:01:48.298 Dean:    
2022-01-05 11:01:46.558 Dean:    Med. Priority task
2022-01-05 11:01:25.087 Dean:    
2022-01-05 11:01:21.947 Dean:    once evry three/four years?
2022-01-05 11:01:10.946 Dean:    how often does that need doing?
2022-01-05 11:01:01.814 Dean:    expensive job owning a narrow boat
2022-01-05 10:36:00.142 Dean:    recent errors too
2022-01-05 10:35:53.135 Dean:    with a timestamp then I can email 
2022-01-05 10:35:37.245 Dean:    I may log errors to an output log 
2022-01-05 10:35:25.310 Dean:    thinking about that
2022-01-05 10:34:53.558 Dean:    also, for any non-fatal error messages
2022-01-05 10:34:41.159 Dean:    but my next job will be to sort the emails via timestamp and compare that to the chosen interval and then email that text to the recipient
2022-01-05 10:33:57.790 Dean:    I won't be coding for a bit as I have a lot to catch up with
2022-01-05 10:33:32.559 Dean:    glad to hear it is stable for you

2022-01-05 10:32:37.591 Dean:    Good day! Are you awake yet?
2022-01-04 23:14:38.814 Dean:    GoodNigit Harry!
2022-01-04 23:14:34.348 Dean:    Going up the wooden hill.
2022-01-04 20:33:51.568 Dean:    it is a basic email client
2022-01-04 20:33:32.137 Dean:    that has no wizard just a simple add account tool
2022-01-04 20:33:21.078 Dean:    so I use Sylpheed another Windows email client
2022-01-04 20:32:53.249 Dean:    or set up test accounts to poll Smtp servers that are malconfigured in some way
2022-01-04 20:32:22.864 Dean:    so you cannot add details for the future
2022-01-04 20:32:07.993 Dean:    Sometimes the wizard won't let you leave until the account details are polling correctly
2022-01-04 20:31:17.448 Dean:    thunderbird is not bad but the new account wizard can be a pain
2022-01-04 18:01:12.211 Dean:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86cQJ0MMses
2022-01-04 18:00:02.904 Dean:    there is a video that is wporth watching onthe subject
2022-01-04 17:59:30.249 Dean:    e
2022-01-04 17:59:28.224 Dean:    or rather slightly beforr that or it would not work
2022-01-04 17:59:11.560 Dean:    then it hands it over to port 587
2022-01-04 17:58:54.080 Dean:    when it has done its job of negotiating the STARTTLS
2022-01-04 17:58:34.560 Dean:    regardless of what you put in the port field for STARTTLS
2022-01-04 17:58:18.665 Dean:    the mitm proxy we have is actually open on port 10025
2022-01-04 17:57:47.649 Dean:    the user can choose
2022-01-04 17:57:38.024 Dean:    I don't restrict a particular port to a type of handshaking/encryption
2022-01-04 17:56:51.272 Dean:    you don't want it falling back to another less powerful mode of encryption or plain text
2022-01-04 17:55:58.448 Dean:    yes, that's basically it.
2022-01-04 15:35:34.352 Dean:    I might add a load and save email configuartions later
2022-01-04 13:19:49.071 Dean:    please replace that into the help folder

2022-01-03 18:39:32.192 Dean:    working on FCW as always
2022-01-03 16:50:40.981 Dean:    which I will update fo email
2022-01-03 16:50:34.241 Dean:    sending you the updated html help shortly
2022-01-03 16:50:13.736 Dean:    I can't control either
2022-01-03 16:50:03.275 Dean:    so it is either google blocking or Win10/11
2022-01-03 16:49:47.894 Dean:    my gmail is working
2022-01-03 16:49:32.832 Dean:    it is too much of a pain
2022-01-03 16:49:23.151 Dean:    but I am done with gmail for now
2022-01-03 16:49:10.839 Dean:    all looks good
2022-01-03 16:48:50.815 Dean:    you can remove that junk from the file now
2022-01-03 16:45:06.890 Dean:    that will help to narrow it down
2022-01-03 16:44:54.116 Dean:    it'll be Win10/11
2022-01-03 16:44:44.825 Dean:    or
2022-01-03 16:44:42.255 Dean:    then it will work for you
2022-01-03 16:44:36.545 Dean:    get a hotmail account for testing
2022-01-03 16:44:25.692 Dean:    so, dump it for the moment
2022-01-03 16:44:14.071 Dean:    but remember gmail is probably blocking you
2022-01-03 16:44:01.640 Dean:    send me your settings.ini
2022-01-03 16:43:42.727 Dean:    so previous attempts could be read
2022-01-03 16:43:29.944 Dean:    but I added the clear button instead to allow the user to clear it when he wanted to
2022-01-03 16:43:06.102 Dean:    I was considering clearing it before each poll
2022-01-03 16:42:51.228 Dean:    and you will see the latest poll
2022-01-03 16:42:44.307 Dean:    you need to scroll down
2022-01-03 16:42:37.866 Dean:    it is at the top
2022-01-03 16:42:33.056 Dean:    if you see the scrollbox
2022-01-03 16:42:11.402 Dean:    so it does not confuse between connections
2022-01-03 16:42:01.291 Dean:    Don't forget to clear the window
2022-01-03 16:30:42.917 Dean:    Ping response. Refresh interval: 15  OS:Windows 7 Professional  Version:0.0.1827
2022-01-03 15:55:10.099 Dean:    often it is immediate and then sometimes it can be ten mins or so
2022-01-03 15:54:52.927 Dean:    sometimes gmail can take a long time to process the emails when successfully sent
2022-01-03 15:54:38.544 Dean:    re: FCW and email
2022-01-03 15:54:33.583 Dean:

2022-01-03 15:53:48.670 Dean:    ino black bin bags
2022-01-03 15:53:39.308 Dean:    bric a brac
2022-01-03 15:53:23.498 Dean:    old books left over from Dad's day
2022-01-03 15:53:14.477 Dean:    getting rid of 'stuff' from tmy study
2022-01-03 15:53:04.976 Dean:    
2022-01-03 15:52:44.524 Dean:    so here is the new version, just one line removed
2022-01-03 15:52:32.421 Dean:    <><>FireCallWin.exe
2022-01-03 15:52:11.728 Dean:    it just does not produce the 'extra' junk
2022-01-03 15:51:55.867 Dean:    but essentially it is the same code
2022-01-03 15:51:47.825 Dean:    I have now removed that
2022-01-03 15:51:38.474 Dean:    the junk in the file was a result of my test code
2022-01-03 13:29:14.192 Dean:    that we can never handle
2022-01-03 13:29:05.900 Dean:    it has another level of app security
2022-01-03 13:28:52.728 Dean:    I have also tested yahoo email and that cannot be implemented
2022-01-03 13:28:15.893 Dean:    
2022-01-03 13:28:12.702 Dean:    hideen behind an abnormal GUI
2022-01-03 13:27:56.347 Dean:    as it seems to have no hidden security
2022-01-03 13:27:38.142 Dean:    I will use hotmail to test from now on
2022-01-03 13:27:27.240 Dean:    so I want no more to do with gmail
2022-01-03 13:27:18.676 Dean:    and it said you had to authorise on your huawaei tablet for me to continue
2022-01-03 13:26:55.824 Dean:    it said NO
2022-01-03 13:26:50.704 Dean:    I no longer have access to your gmail
2022-01-03 13:26:41.973 Dean:    and you have to dig into gmail to fox that
2022-01-03 13:26:30.511 Dean:    as gmail simply says NO
2022-01-03 13:26:23.281 Dean:    we could have managed to get the config correct for gmail may times and it would not have mattered
2022-01-03 13:25:55.029 Dean:    so it will be a better test
2022-01-03 13:25:47.149 Dean:    no security there
2022-01-03 13:25:41.908 Dean:    is to create a hotmail account
2022-01-03 13:25:35.417 Dean:    next thing you could test
2022-01-03 13:25:28.277 Dean:    so I am going to leave it
2022-01-03 13:25:20.514 Dean:    it works here!
2022-01-03 13:16:38.531 Dean:    but I have learnt a lot
2022-01-03 13:16:30.008 Dean:    I've spent ages on it
2022-01-03 13:16:11.125 Dean:    
2022-01-03 13:16:09.654 Dean:    and I was right
2022-01-03 13:16:04.334 Dean:    I knew that email was going to be awful
2022-01-03 13:15:55.543 Dean:    
2022-01-03 13:15:54.923 Dean:    but if it does not work then I will need the alternative
2022-01-03 13:15:40.750 Dean:    and because of stability/known bugs
2022-01-03 13:15:28.608 Dean:    I prefer to use the APIs where possible for consistency
2022-01-03 13:15:09.405 Dean:    I still have my alternative code just in case
2022-01-03 13:14:57.223 Dean:    I may well still have a problem with using the APIs
2022-01-03 13:14:38.772 Dean:    and I will look into the rubbish later
2022-01-03 13:14:28.879 Dean:    just try as it is
2022-01-03 13:14:23.729 Dean:    don't edit the rubbish
2022-01-03 13:14:03.798 Dean:    and match that
2022-01-03 13:14:00.608 Dean:    see last PNG I sent you
2022-01-03 13:13:37.054 Dean:    smtpServer=smtp.gmail.com
2022-01-03 13:12:48.208 Dean:    smtp.gmail.com
2022-01-03 13:12:22.392 Dean:    smtp server is incorrect
2022-01-03 10:42:53.470 Dean:    and you need to go in and for each, accept that the activity was yours...
2022-01-03 10:42:28.775 Dean:    as it had done
2022-01-03 10:42:26.175 Dean:    and automatically block it
2022-01-03 10:42:11.655 Dean:    it may log suspicious activity from a machine/app combination
2022-01-03 10:41:29.353 Dean:    this means logging into google dashboard and becoming familiar with it
2022-01-03 10:41:11.975 Dean:    in oorder to operate in a 'norma;' fashion
2022-01-03 10:38:24.489 Dean:    Well, these new security protocols mean that you have to maintain your settings on the dashboard and respond to events
2022-01-03 01:41:01.103 Dean:    goodnight!
2022-01-03 00:30:24.838 Dean:    none encountered with hotmail
2022-01-03 00:30:10.662 Dean:    we hit three levels just when checking the account
2022-01-03 00:29:44.416 Dean:    as it is too riddled with security checks
2022-01-03 00:29:29.279 Dean:    I would do that rather then use the google mail
2022-01-03 00:29:12.015 Dean:    and easy to test
2022-01-03 00:29:07.582 Dean:    easy to enter the details
2022-01-03 00:29:02.078 Dean:    easy to create
2022-01-03 00:28:56.591 Dean:    we know that process works
2022-01-03 00:28:49.358 Dean:    you can create a hotmail account
2022-01-03 00:28:34.847 Dean:    is ti now only google that is being a pain
2022-01-03 00:28:26.462 Dean:    those two message prove the concept works
2022-01-03 00:28:09.487 Dean:    as your details are being used in multiple locations
2022-01-03 00:27:51.398 Dean:    and I suspect we are making more now
2022-01-03 00:27:43.623 Dean:    and cleared them
2022-01-03 00:27:40.182 Dean:    I found two of those on your google dashboard
2022-01-03 00:27:30.166 Dean:    and raising suspiocious activity alarms
2022-01-03 00:27:15.210 Dean:    What might be happening is that gmail is recognising emails being sent from two different places
2022-01-03 00:25:56.939 Dean:    <><>gmailSettings.jpg
2022-01-03 00:25:10.415 Dean:    wait a sec
2022-01-03 00:01:05.675 Dean:    but I think I have done what was needed
2022-01-03 00:00:56.325 Dean:    it won't even let me look at your details any further
2022-01-03 00:00:33.948 Dean:    email from your account is now working
2022-01-03 00:00:23.573 Dean:    any how, regardless of that
2022-01-02 23:58:49.534 Dean:    then send me the code
2022-01-02 23:58:30.774 Dean:    what a bloody to-do!
2022-01-02 23:58:10.785 Dean:    Choose an account to get your code
2022-01-02 23:58:10.733 Dean:    Under 'Signing in to Google' tap Security code
2022-01-02 23:58:10.678 Dean:    Select the Security tab (you may need to scroll to the right)
2022-01-02 23:58:10.567 Dean:    Tap Manage your Google Account
2022-01-02 23:58:10.521 Dean:    Choose your account, if it not already selected
2022-01-02 23:58:10.481 Dean:    Tap Google
2022-01-02 23:58:10.430 Dean:    Open the Settings app
2022-01-02 23:57:56.430 Dean:    it wants you to sign in on your Huawei HUWEI MediaPad T3
2022-01-02 23:57:26.567 Dean:    it is riddled with security
2022-01-02 23:57:15.847 Dean:    bloody hell
2022-01-02 23:53:22.783 Dean:    I'll do some digging
2022-01-02 23:53:17.966 Dean:    I'm in
2022-01-02 23:52:23.702 Dean:    send it to me ASAP please
2022-01-02 23:45:59.470 Dean:    to the phone ending in 35
2022-01-02 23:45:53.006 Dean:    it has sent you a verification code
2022-01-02 22:54:12.399 Dean:    please do so and I should be able to check
2022-01-02 22:53:29.334 Dean:    it should ask you to validate my device (windows via firefox)
2022-01-02 22:53:08.750 Dean:
2022-01-02 22:53:02.466 Dean:    I am trying to log into your google account via webmail so I can check the settings
2022-01-02 22:37:59.895 Dean:    that will hopefully be more reliable
2022-01-02 22:37:42.407 Dean:    I have a new and more powerful encryption method too
2022-01-02 22:37:27.186 Dean:    and then test of Win10 and all may be revealed
2022-01-02 22:37:17.503 Dean:    so, I am going to stop for a while
2022-01-02 22:37:06.183 Dean:    Well, I am email here, there and everywhere

2022-01-02 21:56:12.002 Dean:    I am using the old API again

2022-01-02 19:08:22.814 Dean:    no wonder it was hard to find
2022-01-02 19:08:13.622 Dean:    one tiny character!
2022-01-02 19:08:01.757 Dean:    there is a bug in the encryption routine
2022-01-02 19:07:19.533 Dean:    then decrypt on the fly
2022-01-02 19:07:08.557 Dean:    yes

2022-01-02 18:56:32.461 Dean:    sorry
2022-01-02 18:56:29.798 Dean:    I emailed you the latest
2022-01-02 18:56:24.245 Dean:    did you take the latest FCWin?
2022-01-02 18:55:56.973 Dean:    which I suspect
2022-01-02 18:55:52.718 Dean:    I will try it on Win10 and see if the problems are specific to it
2022-01-02 18:55:35.302 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:55:33.198 Dean:    I have proven it works
2022-01-02 18:55:25.701 Dean:    I have the app working for email from Win7 using four accounts
2022-01-02 18:55:07.669 Dean:    so,
2022-01-02 18:55:04.277 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:54:59.206 Dean:    too much security, too much to code
2022-01-02 18:54:47.629 Dean:    in fact I think email will die if it all becomes too complex
2022-01-02 18:54:31.118 Dean:    email clients are dying out
2022-01-02 18:54:12.702 Dean:    email is becoming too complex!
2022-01-02 18:54:01.621 Dean:    Thunderbird and sylpheed
2022-01-02 18:53:53.989 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:53:49.398 Dean:    tried two clients both failed
2022-01-02 18:53:35.422 Dean:    So that was pointless
2022-01-02 18:53:23.789 Dean:    a total failure
2022-01-02 18:53:20.069 Dean:    I have just spent hours creating a yahoo email account and trying to confugure my client (TB) to work with it
2022-01-02 18:52:54.685 Dean:
2022-01-02 18:52:50.766 Dean:    Well, I give up for the moment
2022-01-02 16:36:15.157 Dean:    do you have any other email account?

2022-01-02 16:06:34.421 Dean:    but it does not work for your details
2022-01-02 16:06:25.725 Dean:    and it works for me
2022-01-02 16:06:21.885 Dean:    it passes the correct password to gmail SMTP server
2022-01-02 16:06:06.101 Dean:    I have ensured that ALL is now working as it should be
2022-01-02 16:05:55.956 Dean:
2022-01-02 13:37:06.564 Dean:    fixing
2022-01-02 13:37:03.580 Dean:    jsut not enough...
2022-01-02 13:36:59.108 Dean:    reliable
2022-01-02 13:36:56.268 Dean:    but more rleiable
2022-01-02 13:36:48.828 Dean:    same as the Win APIs
2022-01-02 13:36:42.036 Dean:    but not others...
2022-01-02 13:36:35.724 Dean:    some password combinations were working
2022-01-02 13:36:22.124 Dean:    not difficult
2022-01-02 13:36:19.028 Dean:    so, my workaround routines need rejigging
2022-01-02 13:36:04.252 Dean:    the FSO method does handle unicode supposedly but there is another bug as the writing does not
2022-01-02 13:35:27.044 Dean:    I have to rewrite my two routines to use the unicode method of writing that I am using for the main data files
2022-01-02 13:34:54.640 Dean:
2022-01-02 13:08:05.594 Dean:    still a bug to be ironed out
2022-01-02 13:07:59.268 Dean:    don't do it yet

2022-01-02 13:02:44.232 Dean:
2022-01-02 12:45:58.675 Dean:    but it matters not
2022-01-02 12:45:53.417 Dean:    so slower
2022-01-02 12:45:49.148 Dean:    have to read/write whole file/write updated date to temporary file and then rename/delete old
2022-01-02 12:45:15.061 Dean:    they do not read/write using keys so a little slower
2022-01-02 12:45:00.861 Dean:    so, two new routines created as a workaround
2022-01-02 12:44:42.339 Dean:    but that only occurred when I changed the variable name
2022-01-02 12:44:03.419 Dean:    then it happened to the writing too
2022-01-02 12:43:55.740 Dean:    for a while it was only the reading of the data
2022-01-02 12:43:43.930 Dean:    happened randomly
2022-01-02 12:43:30.995 Dean:    it was the API havig a wobbly when writing my encrypted data
2022-01-02 12:43:10.431 Dean:
2022-01-02 12:43:01.818 Dean:    I will test with your gmail SMTP details shortly
2022-01-02 12:42:38.928 Dean:    I was just able to send emails to your address using gmail and my own details in the SMTP server
2022-01-02 11:44:51.331 Dean:    Please check your email

2022-01-02 11:29:34.822 Dean:    my boy was out and I had to wait up for him
2022-01-02 11:29:04.704 Dean:    late one last night
2022-01-02 11:28:08.296 Dean:    How are you today?
2022-01-02 11:28:00.338 Dean:    Good Morning!
2022-01-02 01:12:51.251 Dean:    SO many bugs in Windows and none of them MINE!
2022-01-02 01:12:37.956 Dean:
2022-01-02 01:01:59.783 Dean:    TTFN, Cheerio!
2022-01-02 00:48:10.831 Dean:    I will send you the new version whan I have tested it
2022-01-02 00:19:06.553 Dean:    and it is
2022-01-02 00:19:04.758 Dean:    just tested it is inow writing correctly
2022-01-02 00:18:50.825 Dean:    but it will work
2022-01-02 00:18:43.740 Dean:    it is now slower to read and write the settings.ini file
2022-01-02 00:18:30.385 Dean:    just as I did when reading
2022-01-02 00:18:21.662 Dean:    so I have bypassed the API
2022-01-02 00:18:11.410 Dean:    but the API that writes the string to the INI file was placing four strange double chars after the encrypted password
2022-01-02 00:17:22.130 Dean:    but the password itself was encrypted and written identically
2022-01-02 00:17:04.093 Dean:    I changed the key from pop3Password to SMTPPassword
2022-01-02 00:16:11.961 Dean:    and with those passwords
2022-01-02 00:16:00.881 Dean:    it was working
2022-01-02 00:15:56.575 Dean:    yes it is the write API
2022-01-02 00:15:51.301 Dean:
2022-01-01 23:06:09.516 Dean:    but I will need to determine why, all of a sudden
2022-01-01 23:05:55.363 Dean:    I think the write API is doing the same
2022-01-01 23:05:43.395 Dean:    due to a failure of the read API to recognise some chars
2022-01-01 23:05:26.450 Dean:    the API that reads from an INI file has been replaced by a manual tool that does the same
2022-01-01 23:05:02.966 Dean:    same again
2022-01-01 23:05:00.267 Dean:    I think I have found the bug
2022-01-01 23:04:50.843 Dean:
2022-01-01 22:43:00.157 Dean:    I need to find out why
2022-01-01 22:42:50.391 Dean:    I think the password is being decrypted incorrectly at the time it tests
2022-01-01 22:42:28.419 Dean:    I will research
2022-01-01 22:42:23.099 Dean:    stop for the moment
2022-01-01 22:40:25.864 Dean:    but it worked well, we have probably flooded it with incorrect credentials
2022-01-01 22:40:04.253 Dean:    gmail has stopped working here too
2022-01-01 21:54:36.868 Dean:    and I'll try and decrypt it here
2022-01-01 21:54:15.803 Dean:    would you send me your encrypted pass code from the settings.ini that resulted in redaxota's
2022-01-01 21:53:32.192 Dean:    it is strange, that incorrect reading of the password
2022-01-01 21:52:28.134 Dean:    back again
2022-01-01 17:27:45.102 Dean:    Popping out for a while, should be back soon.
2022-01-01 17:26:15.162 Dean:    should be just redaxota
2022-01-01 17:25:51.694 Dean:    there were extra characters
2022-01-01 17:25:44.798 Dean:    on your pipex pwd
2022-01-01 17:25:37.791 Dean:
2022-01-01 17:24:39.196 Dean:    unsure what some of the chars might be
2022-01-01 17:24:24.748 Dean:    can you send it here as text pls
2022-01-01 17:24:16.712 Dean:    your password for gmail
2022-01-01 17:22:23.877 Dean:    pipex was the most tricky
2022-01-01 16:04:09.195 Dean:    y
2022-01-01 16:04:07.026 Dean:    and ou have to say yes to network access if it does...
2022-01-01 16:03:52.482 Dean:    The firewall message will pop up
2022-01-01 16:02:53.600 Dean:    as those a re live accounts
2022-01-01 16:02:47.547 Dean:    please destroy them afterwards!
2022-01-01 16:02:25.592 Dean:    so you can try those if you want
2022-01-01 16:02:19.037 Dean:
2022-01-01 16:02:05.867 Dean:    including passwords
2022-01-01 16:01:59.142 Dean:    Those are the details of the accounts I have tested so far
2022-01-01 16:01:32.824 Dean:    enabled allow insecure apps in google's dashboard
