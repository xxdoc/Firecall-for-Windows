      <h2>Fire Call Win</h2>



















Fire Call Win is a simple chat tool that allows two users, typically
developers, to communicate person-to-person using encrypted transfer
via&nbsp; shared files and folders. Files can be transferred and
exchanged, chat
and data swapped on almost&nbsp;real-time basis. This version uses
the
basic Dropbox service to share files and folders but it can also use
any shared file or folder resource over a network of some sort as long
as it appears as a locally accessible resource to Windows. In addition
to chat,
Emojis, voice recordings and user files can be shared too.<br>



















      <br>



















This&nbsp;program is free and FOSS. The basic file and folder
sharing
services are free, this program uses Dropbox out of the box but Google
Drive and Microsoft's Onedrive all provide basic file and folder
sharing facilities for free.<br>



















&nbsp;<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 679px; height: 706px;" alt="FireCall for Windows Main User Interface" title="FireCall for Windows Main User Interface" src="fireCallMain01.png"><br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 01 FireCall
&nbsp;for Windows Main User Interface</span><br>



















      <br>



















Developed in VB6, it is a 32bit program (all hail 32bits!)&nbsp;
that allows chat to take place
between both Windows and Mac OS/X users using DropBox as the
interchange medium. In addition to the VB6 version there is also a
version that
uses javascript on Mac OS/X. They use the same methodology to
successfully communicate with each other on multiple o/s. The
javascript version works on Windows as well so you are spolit for
choice as
to which you can use!
This help file describes the Windows version <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span>.<br>



















      <br>



















Minimum configuration: From Windows XP to current Windows versions. Any
version of Windows 32/64bit
from XP upward that have the VB6 runtime. All versions of Windows have
the VB6 runtime
pre-installed so FCW works on any Windows PC. Tested on Windows XP, Win
7 and 10. Should also be tested on Win11 shortly.<br>


      <br>


Please be aware that this program requires the standard display
configuration of 96 DPI or 100% scaling. It has not been designed to
operate on higher magnifications or increased DPI.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h3>Program Configuration.</h3>



















When the program first runs it needs to have some configuration options
filled in. Fire Call Win will prompt you to set the location for
the input and output files and the location of the exchange folder. The
preferences screen will automatically run to allow you to set these.<br>



















      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 03 A Portion
of the Preferences General Tab, Input and Output File Fields Highlighted</span><br>



















      <br>



















Enter the location of the input and output files you will be using to
communicate with your partner in the fields above.<br>



















      <br>



















Suggested names : &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">inputFile.txt</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">outputFile.txt</span>.<br>



















      <br>



















      </span>Fire Call Win has two shared files, one is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">input</span> file
from which
you will receive updates from your partner. The other is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">output</span>file
where your own updates will be written and sent to your partner. The
location where you store these files must be on a shared network drive
so you can both see them.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Exchange Folder:</h4>



















The third essential setting is the exchange folder. This is the
location
that Fire Call Win will use to store files that are&nbsp;shared
between two chat
partners. This folder&nbsp;must be created, located in a shared
network location and then entered into Fire
Call Win's configuration. This will enable drag and drop and thus allow
the sharing of files between you.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h3>Dropbox File and Folder Sharing</h3>



















If you are not using Dropbox then skip this section. <br>



















      <br>



















The location where you store these files must be shared within Dropbox
so you can both see them.
Visit dropbox for more detailed instructions on how to share a
folder with another user. You do need some basic familiarity with
sharing
files using dropbox, how to share files and folders and how to create
files in a shared area. If you have that knowledge then proceed, if
not, then go and watch a youtube tutorial! <br>



















      <br>



















Basically the method is this: Open dropbox
using its web interface (you must have an account and be logged in) and
look for the "shared" menu option. At that point there
will be a button to create a shared folder, you simply specify the
name and who you want to share it with. That person clearly must have a
dropbox account too. Once the Dropbox sharing is resolved Fire Call Win
will be able to use it as the&nbsp;communications medium to your
partner. <br>



















      <br>



















Next, you must create two files and share them with your partner as
described above - and
once done you need to enter their location into Fire Call
Win.&nbsp;The
dropbox folder is the location where all your dropbox files are
synched. The two files required are simple text files. Create them
yourself
manually in the dropbox folder.<br>



















That's it! A lot more simple in reality than it sounds.<br>



















      <br>



















If you open the program interface of DropBox and select Preferences,
you will see this screen. Dropbox makes a copy of all your shared
folders and locates this in the
folder specified above. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This
is where you will place your files</span>.<br>

      <h3>Program Operation</h3>



















When the basic configuration tasks are done, FCW will start and show
a screen similar to the one above but with no chat text in the two chat
windows. The chat boxes are empty as you have not yet started to chat.
If you hover your mouse over any component a tooltip will pop up
briefly stating what the component does.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>



















      <br>



















      </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Upper
Chat Window </span><br>



















      <br>



















The top chat contains your chat partner's texts and
messages.&nbsp;This is known as
the <span style="font-style: italic;">input</span>
box displaying the contents of the shared <span style="font-style: italic;">input</span> file.<br>



















      <br>

LIT <img style="width: 21px; height: 21px;" alt="Polling and Data Update Lamps" title="Polling and Data Update Lamps" src="btnpictimerlampbright.jpg">.
When the right lamp is lit continuously it means that you have an
update from your chat partner in chat. The left hand lamp will
regularly
glow for 5 seconds to indicate that the tool is successfully polling
the shared data area. It does this according to an interval set in the
preferences. If Fire Call Win ever fails to obtain the data from the
shared location an error message will pop up telling you of the problem.<br>

      <br>



















The polling lamp also has another function, you may double-click on it
to refresh
both chat windows,&nbsp;this will also initiate a poll of the input
file.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>The Attach Button</h4>



















This allows you to select a single file to send to your chat partner.
This will open a file
selection box. Select a file, press OK and it will be sent. It will be
copied to the FCW exchange folder. The chat partner will receive a
notification.<br>



















      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 12 The Attach
Button</span><br>



















      <br>



















In addition to attaching a file via this button you can also Drag and
Drop files onto either chat window and your chat partner will receive a
notification of the event. The files you drag to the chat window will
be
copied to the FCW exchange folder. Dropbox will then automatically
synch the file so that it is available to your chat partner. The speed
of
the synchronisation is dependant upon the size of the file you are
attaching and the speed of your internet/dropbox settings. It does not
matter which window you drag to, the drag will be considered a share to
your remote partner. You may only drag <span style="text-decoration: underline;">single</span>
files or a single folder but please
understand that dragging an entire folder may have unexpected results
due to time taken and space utilisation. Note: Dropbox has a limit on
space utilisation so don't drag and drop a large folder.<br>

      <br>



















The config button opens the Preferences Utility where you can
change the program settings. <br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Note:
the program will stop
automatically polling for new data whilst the preferences window is
open. Close it and automatic polling will restart.</span><br>

      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Preferences Panel</span></h3>



















The General Panel contains the most important user-configurable items
required for the program to operate correctly. If these items are not
filled in then FireCall will not operate at all.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> <img style="width: 592px; height: 551px;" alt="The Preferences General Tab in full." title="The Preferences General Tab in full." src="FCWPrefs01.png"><br>

The use of the input, output and exchange fields. was covered earlier
in the explanation section.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Refresh interval</h4>



















The refresh interval is the polling time. Setting this to just a few
seconds will make the chat feel much more real-time. Extending it just
slows down the discussion, which may be preferable when you are
busy or if you are not bothered about chat turnaround.<br>



















      <br>



















      <br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Configuration Panel</span></h3>



















The configuration panel is the location for optional configuration
items. These items change how FireCall operates, configure them to suit
your needs and your mode of operation.<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 592px; height: 680px;" alt="FCWPrefsConfig.png" title="FCWPrefsConfig.png" src="FCWPrefsConfig.png"><br>

      <h4>Target Client</h4>



















The target client&nbsp;is an option that you may not need to change
unless you are communicating with the javascript
version of the FireCall app that runs on Mac OS X. That version
requires UTF8 support to display and handle unicode characters. If you
are a Windows user communicating with FireCall for&nbsp;Windows you
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not
need to select the UTF8 option</span>. However, the code we use
to handle UTF8 files may be faster
for reading and writing the input/output data files, so by all means
try it out.<br>



















      <br>



















If you have the ANSI option enabled and your partner sends you Unicode
characters then they will appear as in the the chat window shown below,
some strange squiggly characters are displayed instead of those sent.
This is due to a limitation of ANSI not FCW. To see these characters as
they are meant to be displayed simply select UTF8.<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 488px; height: 283px;" alt="Example Partner's Chat Window" title="Example Partner's Chat Window" src="FCWTopBox.png"><br>

      <h4>Prefix String</h4>



















The prefix is a&nbsp;string that will precede all your text
messages. The window above shows the prefix string set to "Harry".<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Load at Bottom </h4>



















The Load at Bottom checkbox determines whether the chat texts are top
or bottom-loaded.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Single Chat Window</h4>



















The Single Chat Window will merge the chatboxes to just a single box,
this will converge functionality with the Yahoo widget version of Fire
Call that has a single chat window by default. The text from both
windows is merged, sorted and displayed as one.<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 677px; height: 704px;" alt="FCWCombinedText.png" title="FCWCombinedText.png" src="FCWCombinedText.png"><br>

      <h4>Maximum line length </h4>



















The Maximum line length option will cause any lines you type in to be
cropped when the line length reaches the set limit. The line will then
be split into two or more lines. The line length option only affects
lines currently being typed in, not older lines already contained
within the chat.<br>



















      <br>



















Note that you can resize the FCW window horizontally so that your
longest messages will be readable without too much scrolling. Just grab the far right window border and drag it to the right.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Enable Scrollbars</h4>



















Enable scrollbars option will enable or disable the vertical and
horizontal
scrollbars in all chat windows. Scrolling is then achieved by use of
the keyboard up and down keys.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Enable Tooltips </h4>



















Enable Tooltips will enable or disable the tooltips on the main
application window.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Iconise Delay</h4>



















Iconise delay - this controls the delay after which the application
will be iconised or minimised to the desktop. This is not a Windows
minimise but an
program iconise. After iconisation the program will look exactly like
the following
icon. You can place the icon wherever you want on the desktop and it
will remember the location even after shutdown and restart. The reason
for this type of iconisation is to minimise desktop space utilisation
and to allow the&nbsp;program to alert you to any incoming text.<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 77px; height: 93px;" alt="fireCall.jpg" title="fireCall.jpg" src="fireCall.jpg"><br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 20 The Program
Iconised</span><br>



















      <br>



















The icon image will pulsate when a incoming message has arrived. Double
clicking on this icon will cause the main program to re-appear. The
data change lamp will be lit <img style="width: 21px; height: 21px;" alt="btnpictimerlampbright.jpg" title="btnpictimerlampbright.jpg" src="btnpictimerlampbright.jpg">.
To clear this&nbsp;click on the lamp or the text input area, this
tells
the program that you have acknowledged your receipt of new text.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Allow Remote Partner to Shutdown this app</h4>



















This determines
whether your remote partner has the capability of issuing shutdown
requests to your copy of Fire Call prior to him
performing&nbsp;administration or housekeeping tasks such as
reducing
the
size of the text files used to store the chat text. If these tasks are
carried out whilst FCW is running it could cause the app some problems.
Having the ability to indicate the need for a shutdown to your partner
is a useful tool.<br>



















      <br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Email
Panel</span></h3>



















The email panel is where you will configure FCW to work with your email
client in order to send email messages about the current state of FCW.
Some email options are not yet implemented fully so lower your
expectations in the
respect of this panel.<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 589px; height: 681px;" alt="FCWPrefsEmail.png" title="FCWPrefsEmail.png" src="FCWEmailsTab01.png"><br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 21a&nbsp;
The Preferences Panel Showing the Email Tab.</span><br>



















      <br>






      <span style="font-style: italic;">



Read all the following if you want to configure email!</span><br>










      <br>



















Before you proceed, please be aware that email is always more complicated than you think. Don't
underestimate how difficult it will be for you to configure email correctly (and for the poor developer to have to code an email
application in VB6). If you don't need email then we suggest you leave this tab well alone!
With that thought in mind, we have greyed out the majority of options on this tab
until either one of the two main check box options are marked with a tick.<br>



















      <br>



















The email tab allows the user to enter details of their email provider's
SMTP settings so that the program can automatically email a chosen
recipient. These emails can be sent on the occurrence of two events: firstly, if
FireCall experiences or recovers from an error; secondly, it can summarise recent chat
activity and email&nbsp;the recipient in the form of a text message
containing all the recent chat. For example, if you are on holiday then
you might prefer to have your partner's chat contents&nbsp;emailed to
you or forwarded to another email address.<br>

















      <br>

















When you first attempt to use this functionality, your firewall will
create a modal popup requesting that you allow or deny access for this
program to the network. You must reply 'YES' to this if you want
Firecall to be able to send advisory emails. If you say NO accidentally and want
to&nbsp;use this functionality in the future you will have to know how
to administer your own system firewall to re-enable FireCall's access to the
network. This guide cannot help you with this as all Microsoft and 3rd party firewalls have their own configuration methods...<br>



















&nbsp;<br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Send Advice Emails</span> <br>

















      <br>

















Ticking this check box will cause regular emails to be sent on the
interval specified containing a text record of recent chats.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advice Interval</span> <br>

















      <br>






Select the interval that any email will be sent. When an email is
currently underway you may notice a temporary interruption to the clock
and other functions within FCW. The routine is looping through
recent&nbsp;messages then using system functions to email that
information.The routing runs&nbsp;in an asynchronous timer but uses
some cpu to complete, especially when there are a lot of messages to
send. This causes the slow down. We suggest that you set the tool to
email no less than every five hours.<br>






A small email icon will be displayed just above the clock to inform you that an email routine is underway. &nbsp;<img style="width: 30px; height: 26px;" alt="letter-icon.jpg" title="letter-icon.jpg" src="letter-icon.jpg"><br>






      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Send Error Emails</span> <br>

















      <br>

















Ticking this check box will cause regular emails to be sent conveying
any recent errors.<br>








      <br>








      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP Configuration</span> <br>

















      <br>








Select which SMTP configuration you would like to operate. You can save up to five alternative configurations.&nbsp;<br>



















      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tag</span> <br>

















      <br>








You can give each of the&nbsp;SMTP configurations a tag, an identifier.
This is just a human readable tag to allow you to more easily
distinguish one configuration from another, for example, Hotmail,
Google, Talk Talk &amp;c.<br>






      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP Server</span> <br>

















      <br>

















This is the
SMTP server name as supplied by your email provider. Enter the email
server's SMTP name here. If you are running Outlook or Thunderbird you
will find this in your email client's outgoing email configuration, eg.
SMTP.PROVIDER.DSL.COM<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP Port </span><br>

















      <br>

















Choose the
SMTP port number, typically port 25, 465 or 587 for TLS. Enter your
email server's SMTP port here, you will find this in your email client
outgoing email configuration, eg. 25<br>



















NOTE: The majority of configuration options on this page
are&nbsp;currently functioning, all except STARTTLS option on port
587. <br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Authentication</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

















      <br>

















Choose the SMTP authentication method, the choices are, None, Base 64
encoded (the normal &nbsp;method) or NTLM if you are communicating
with
the server within a domain.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Security</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>

















      <br>

















Choose the SMTP
security method, the choices are, None, STARTTLS or SSL/TLS.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP Username</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

















      <br>

















Enter your email
server's SMTP username details here, you will find those in your email
client outgoing email configuration <br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SMTP Password </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

















      <br>






Enter your email
server's SMTP password here, you will find your password in your email
client's
outgoing email configuration. When you enter it here, the password will
be stored in FireCall's
settings.ini file in an encrypted format. The encryption is not
particularly deep
but is provided as being&nbsp;enough only to prevent prying eyes, but
that's about all. If an intruder really wanted to break the encryption
it would be possible to do so with a little effort. In any case the
encryption key is stored within the VB6 program, as a string within the
source, so if you have the source you also have the key.&nbsp; My first
suggestion is to change the internal encryption&nbsp;key in FCW by
editing the source and then building FCW yourself. The code is FOSS and
freely available, there is nothing stopping you doing so. My second
suggestion is to
create an email account specifically for sending emails from FireCall
and to use these particular SMTP account details for nothing else. In
that case
if the password is ever compromised it will reveal nothing useful nor
be of any use to anyone.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Reveal
Button</span> &nbsp;<br>

















      <br>

















The small 'Eye' button reveals the
password in plain text. A further press hides it again.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Append the above
details to test emails</span><br>

















      <br>
















Select this option when testing
and it will append the above SMTP details to the test emails in the
subject
and in the email body. This will assist when debugging so that you know
by merely looking at the received emails, which configuration details
resulted in a successful email.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Recipient Email </span><br>

















      <br>






Enter the email target, ie. who you want to receive the email. This
will be used in both the email test and the real advice messages sent
by FCW.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

















      <br>

















Choose a suitable
subject for the email. This will be used in both the email test and the real advice messages sent by FCW.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test Message</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

















      <br>

















Choose some text
to be sent in the body of your test email.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Test Button </span><br>

















      <br>

















When you press TEST it will generate a&nbsp;test email messge for
sending using the SMTP information provided above. Note: The test
button will be greyed out until you save your changes. If all
the fields are filled out and the config. is saved then the TEST button
will be enabled so that you
can test your latest email configuration.<br>


















      <br>

















If there is an error in the email configuration then a response message
may be returned from the server. Be aware that sometimes the server may
return no message at all and that depends upon the server. The timeout
period is 30 seconds so expect a message to return only after that
time, some may not respond for a minute or more.<br>

















      <br>


















Even if successful be aware that emails may take a while to come through, for example,
sending emails via gmail's SMTP server can result in a delay of up to 5

      <br>

















      </span>The connection log panel displays the results of any
negotiation between FireCall and the remote SMTP server. It only
appears for STARTTLS connections.<br>









      <br>









The log panel will display all recent attempts to connect, the latest
details will be appended to the log. Remember to scroll the sesssion to
the end to display the most recent connection or simply CLEAR it at any
time. <br>












      <br>










      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background: </span>In Windows
we
have at our disposal a technology from Microsoft called
CDO, Firecall uses this to make the email point-to-point connection.
Microsoft have
failed to update CDO for a while so STARTTLS is not supported by
default. In order
to make&nbsp;STARTTLS function we have a proxy on port 10025 that takes
any&nbsp;STARTTLS connection and manually injects the&nbsp;STARTTLS
command into the stream just at the right time, for correct
negotiation of a secure connection. Our proxy forwards on&nbsp;the
connection to the user's chosen port. This is the only way to make CDO
negotiate a STARTTLS connection. The process works (emails sent
correctly) and has
been tested on several SMTP account types, the results listed below:<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>


















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test results</span></h3>



















      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Hotmail</span> <br>

















      <br>

















Hotmail's SMTP servers have been successfully tested on port 25 with
SSL/TLS and base 64 authentication. <br>












It has&nbsp;been tested&nbsp;successfully in STARTTLS mode on ports 25 and 587 and base 64 authentication. <br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gmail</span> <br>

















      <br>

















Gmail's SMTP servers have&nbsp;been successfully&nbsp;tested on port 465 with SSL/TLS
and
base 64 authentication.  <br>










It has also been tested&nbsp;successfully in STARTTLS mode on ports 25
and 587 and base 64 authentication. <br>









For weither of the above to be used, the option: "allow insecure apps"
had to
be&nbsp;enabled in google's own dashboard. The Google dashboard
initially recognises any new connections as being trustworthy. You have to
accept each of these accesses as belonging to you and reste them to not being suspicious.
This guide cannot help you further with Google dashboard functionality. It is a pain in the neck to configure and test.<br>




      <br>




Gmail is expected to introduce compulsory OAuth authentication
&nbsp;soon and from that point onward you will not be able to use
Gmail's servers in conjunction with this program.<br>



















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pipex / Talk Talk</span><br>

















      <br>

















Pipex and Talk Talk's SMTP servers specifically require both 587 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> STARTTLS with base 64 authentication. It has&nbsp;been tested&nbsp;successfully in STARTTLS mode.&nbsp;<br>


















      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outlook</span> <br>

















      <br>












Microsoft's SMTP servers require STARTTLS. It has&nbsp;been
tested&nbsp;successfully with&nbsp;STARTTLS on either port 25 or 587 with base 64
authentication. .&nbsp;<br>

















      <br>










      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yahoo</span><br>

















      <br>










FCW email will not work with a Yahoo SMTP server.
Yahoo's SMTP servers require "app authentication" which cannot be
disabled to allow normal TLS handshaking. The result being that a connection cannot be made to Yahoo's SMTP servers.<br>






      <br>

      <br>







I did tell you email isn't easy... Do enjoy testing but please don't
complain to me if it does not work. I will suggest that 100% of
failures will be due to either the misconfiguration of your account details, the
email provider's dashboard or the addition of extra authentication
procedures that this program is unaware of. We have tried to test it all to
exhaustion but there is a limit.<br>

      <h4>Quality</h4>



















The recording quality ranges from s high quality 44100khz in stereo to a low quality 5512 khz in
mono. The quality will significantly affect the size of the wav files
created by recording messages. If you record a lot of messages and only
have a small amount of&nbsp;free space on your shared network drive
then the
lowest quality is the best option to select.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The

The housekeeping panel is where you can configure backups and the
archiving of old data.<br>



















      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 25b The
Preferences Panel Showing the HouseKeeping Tab.<br>



      <br>



      </span>This panel controls housekeeping, ie. the backup and archiving of data.<br>



      
      
      
      <h4>Automatic Housekeeping</h4>



Tick this box to enable automatic housekeeping. This will periodically trim the oldest data from your output file.
      
      
      
      <h4>Day Selection Drop Down</h4>



Use the drop down to select the number of days after which all your&nbsp;old chats will be archived from your output.
      
      
      
      <h4>Archive Location</h4>



















If you click the Archive Location button, a file explorer window
will open at that folder and you will see all the archive files
listed.
Each file has a timestamp preppended to
the filename. Each will contain a portion of your old chats archived from the point when the last archive run occurred.<br>



      <br>



The&nbsp;Archive location can be amended by modifying the FCW settings.ini
file manually that exists in this location:
      <small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\FireCallWin\settings.ini.
      </span><br style="font-family: Courier New;">



      </small>Look for the FCWArchiveFolder variable name and change that to a folder
that exists and is accessible.
      
      
      
      <h4>Backup on Start</h4>



















FCW will take a backup of your output file every time FCW is restarted. Uncheck to disable.<br>



      
      
      
      <h4>Automatic Backups</h4>



















FCW will take a backup of your output file on a regular interval. Uncheck to disable.<br>



      
      
      
      <h4>Backup Interval</h4>



















Adjust the slider to suit the frequency of your backup needs. The slider is graduated in hours.
      
      
      
      <h4>Backup Location</h4>



















FCW takes a
backup copy each time it restarts, it makes a backup of the local copy
of your output text file and stores
that backup in the backup folder which is located here:<br>



















      <small><br>



















      <span style="font-family: Courier New;">C:\program
files(x86)\FireCallWin\backup</span></small><br>



      <br>



The backup location can be amended by modifying the FCW settings.ini file manually that exists here: in&nbsp;<small><span style="font-family: Courier New;">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\FireCallWin\settings.ini</span></small>. <br>



Look for the FCWBackupFolder variable name and change that to a folder that exists and is accessible.<br>



      <br>



















If you click the Backup Location button, a file explorer window
will open at that folder and you will see all the backup files
listed.
Each file has a numerical suffix of .1, .2, .3 &amp;c appended to
the filename. This indicates a
version which is incremented each time a backup occurs. The higher
numbered versions are the most recent. Look after these files, these
are
your backups and you may need to restore one of them if you ever
encounter a data corruption
of some sort. Also, be aware that the number of files in this folder
can grow quite quickly and so you may need to trim the older version
files from time to time.<br>



















      <br>

      <h4>Window Level </h4>



















The Window Level &nbsp;is the position of your program window in
the z
axis. Setting it to keep below all other windows means that it will
drop to the bottom and stay there. Windows will always bring any window
that is in focus to the top but the program will also be trying to keep
itself at the bottom, so that whilst you are working on the window it
will tend to jump forward and back again. If you choose this option
do realise its limitations. It is here as more of an experiment as to
how
to implement a feature, one carried over from the Yahoo Widget
(javascript) version of this program <br>

This option is currently disabled in this program.<br>
      <h4>Iconise to Desktop</h4>
If the Iconise to Desktop option is chosen&nbsp;this will cause the application to iconise to a stamp icon on the desktop. <br>
      <h4>Iconise to Defined Opacity</h4>
If the Iconise to Defined Opacity option is chosen&nbsp;this will
enable the fade out of the program to a pre-defined level of opacity


















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Opacity</h4>
The opacity slider defines the  level of opacity that the application will fade to.<br>
      <h4>Iconise Delay</h4>
The application will iconise after this period of delay. It will fade
or iconise to desktop according to the iconise options chosen above.<br>

This button replaces the standard Window's minimise button but instead
causes the program

by an icon that
sits on the desktop. You can place that icon anywhere you like on the
desktop and it will remember its position when the program is next
restarted.<br>

      <br>



















The right click menu has a few options that are also available through
buttons on the main program. They are here for convenience. Certain
items are unique to the menu. The menu appears when you right click on
any part of the program except for the chatboxes and the clock. The two
chat boxes will show a different right click menu as well as the clock,
described earlier. The preferences window also has a right click menu
that is a subset of the one above.<br>

      <br>



















      </span> The
speaker cover has three buttons, one to record speech, one to play
speech and the other to
halt any current action. The small red lamp on the speaker panel
will light up brightly when recording a message for your chat partner.
The maximum length is 65 seconds. Be aware that if you utilise this
facility a lot you will fill up your dropbox allocation rather quickly!
Best to be brief with your messages and use this function
infrequently... When you have selected a recording to play, the green
button will appear. When you are playing a recording the lamp will
light up brightly but will change from bright green to dull when it has
finished. You cannot record whilst an existing recording is playing.<br>



















      <br>



















Click on pull catch to remove the cover and display the Emoji Panel
below.<br>

The&nbsp;Emoji Control Panel&nbsp;</span><br>



















      <br>



















The Emoji Control Panel shows your current emoji
state&nbsp;on&nbsp;the television screen
and your chat partner's emoji state is available
via&nbsp;print-out. When your chat partner's Emoji status is
changed it will display his Emoji through the use of a print out
animation.
Clicking on the strip of paper (just appearing at the top of the Emoji
Window) will allow you to
see your chat partner's current Emoji state. A small animation will run
when
the paper&nbsp;is first clicked upon. Another click&nbsp;on the
displayed print out will shred it.<br>



















      <br>



















The
left and right&nbsp;hand button allow you to select other emojis
for
viewing on the telly screen. As you select each Emoji, the Emoji
drop-down at the top of the program will change as well. <br>



















      <br>



















Clicking on the speaker grille will toggle&nbsp;the sound partial
mute for the
whole application, changing them from loud to quiet and back again as
required.<br>



















      <br>



















The final control in the emoji panel is the button top right that will
close any displayed image.<br>



















      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Displaying your partner's attached images.</h4>



















When your chat partner sends you an image or other attachment, it will
appear in a picture box in the emoji control panel. If the file is a
known image then it will display the image
itself. If it is a 'known' image format but Windows cannot easily
display it then an appropriate icon will appear in its stead. The
program will attempt to display the following image types -
".jpg,.jpeg,.bmp,.ico,.png,.tif,.tiff,.gif,.cur,.wmf,.emf". <br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 497px; height: 282px;" alt="Example Partner's Chat Window" title="Example Partner's Chat Window" src="inputBoxWavSelected.png"><br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 40 Example

      <br>

      </span>

















When your chat partner sends you a valid file attachment then you can simply open that file
using a
double-click on the link itself or by doucle clicking upon the icon in the picture box.<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 172px; height: 240px;" alt="wavFilePrinting.png" title="wavFilePrinting.png" src="FCWPNGAttached.png"><br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 41 Example
picture box displaying an attached PNG file.</span><br>



















      <br>

Those attachments that it cannot display (due to limitations in the
program or in the
o/s itself) are what we refer to as valid but unknown image types. For
example:&nbsp;.pict,.icns,.svg,.NEF,.CR2,.ORF,.RW2,.ARW,.DNG,.wps,.AI,.PSD,.RAW,.INDD,
HEIC,&nbsp;HEIF
&amp;c. Each of these files will cause an icon to be displayed
(below)&nbsp;that indicates this status. If the underlying o/s (XP, Win
7. 8, 10 or 11) &nbsp;understands and handles the file type then you
may still be able to double click on the icon and Windows may then open
it. Note that some of these file types might require a plugin for
Windows to open them in this fashion, for example, .HEIC images require
a 3rd party plugin to display&nbsp;image-container type files under
Windows 7.<br>

Image Type Encountered Icon</span><br>



















      <br>

If an attachment is valid and known,
in
this case the correct&nbsp; file type icon will be
displayed. For example, if you have been sent an attachment then it will have an
appropriate icon displayed that indicates the file type according to the file
suffix. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>



















      <br>



















The program has a bundle of appropriate but not exhaustive file
type images. The program will select one of each using the file suffix.<br>

      <br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 44 Example
Attachment of a program file of type EXE</span><br>



















      <br>



















A double click on the icon picture
box will open the&nbsp;attachment using the
default application. In the above case&nbsp;Windows will open the
attached EXE file and run it (with a warning), so please take care! If an audio file is
selected Windows media player will
open and play the WAV file. What happens is basically down to your Windows
configuration and the default application types selected by the user. If the file type is
completely unknown&nbsp;then the following icon will be displayed
in
its stead.<br>



















      <br>



















      <img style="width: 188px; height: 188px;" alt="document-attachments-unknown.png" title="document-attachments-unknown.png" src="document-attachments-unknow.png"><br>



















      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig.45 Unknown

      <br>



















If an attachment has expired, ie. the shared image has been deleted
from the shared area then a click upon an old image referenced in the chat
window, will fail. It will no longer show an image or attachment type as the file has disappeared, as far
as the program is concerned. In
this case the following image icon will be shown.<br>

slowly or locking a file during an update this message may appear. A
slow internet or synching some large files may cause this situation.
What can you do to alleviate this, kick the kids off the internet, turn
off all your streaming televisions, and all the other pointless devices
that consume bandwidth, restart Dropbox or switch broadband providers,
the choice is yours. You could always move to the city.<br>

This message only occurred once during testing and I could find no
reason for it. There is no mitigation offered for an error that may
never be displayed again. Regardless, for this and any other error
message displayed by the program, please report it. Every function in
the program has an error trap and it will be useful to know what errors
have occurred so I can improve the program,<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

      <h3>Technology:&nbsp;<br>



















      </h3>



















The utility was created using VB6, a language that&nbsp;was once
Microsoft's vaunted flagship
language. It was built upon Windows 7, Microsoft's last good desktop
operating system, I also used&nbsp;vBAdvance, MZ-TOOLS 3.0, CodeHelp Core
IDE Extender
Framework
2.2 &amp; Rubberduck 2.4.1. I used VB6 to prove it can be done and also to reacquaint
myself
with the technology. The utility will be migrated to
VB.NET
so eventually there will be a version that is both future-proof and
64bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;

This
program was built with the assistance of various snippets or chunks of
FOSS code. VB6 has been around for so long that&nbsp;the
extant&nbsp; codebase
is
immense. You can always find snippets to do this or that and it makes
your development task <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immeasurably</span> easier.&nbsp;

Finally, credit to Harry Whitfield, Emeritus Professor of Computing,
University of
Newcastle upon Tyne, for helping me with ideas, testing and being a
sounding board for my ideas. I would have done none of this without him
as he is my programming Yoda and my inspiration to do better. Harry
coded the original Fire Call program in javascript using an idea we
came up with together. We worked further to create the Yahoo Widget
version that also still exists today - that became&nbsp;an
inspiration
for the VB6 version you are using now.<br>

      <h3>Donations:</h3>



















Bonkers people like myself create these tools and we do it
for&nbsp;nothing,
for
free, gratis. However, it makes my day when someone sends a gift, a
treat or a present and it inspires me to do more. In all the time that
I have created all these tools (thirty or more tools) I have received
no more than a dozen or so
gifts but when someone has done so I feel like I have just
inherited&nbsp;a new friend. All I ask is that if you use this tool
and
continue to do so, consider sending me something small once every few
years. I have a penchant for licorice and cheap SSDs, the former is
cheap and brings a smile to my face, the latter has me running round
the room in circles.<br>
